<p class="ac lg125">PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.</p>

  <p>It may be necessary in introducing this little volume, to state, that
  it is strictly conchological, and that it is compiled for the use not
  only of those who wish to acquire an elementary acquaintance with the
  subject, but also of authors and others, who, desirous of extending their
  knowledge and pursuing their researches, require a book of reference,
  containing a general outline of what has been done by those who have
  trodden the same path before them. It has been thought advisable, for
  general convenience, to arrange the principal part of the information in
  alphabetical order: adding tables of the systems of Lamarck and De
  Blainville, to facilitate the systematic pursuit of the science.</p>

  <p>Persons of the class first alluded to, will find great assistance in
  the explanation of technical words, their application being further
  illustrated, in most cases, by a reference to the figures; and, although
  they might have been multiplied, it is trusted that enough are given for
  every useful purpose.</p>

  <p>The definition of the Classes, Orders, Families, and Genera, in the
  system of De Blainville, and a tabular view, are presented for the use of
  those who prefer it, or who wish to compare it with that of Lamarck.</p>

  <p>In the explanation of the figures, will be found a systematic
  arrangement of shells, according to Lamarck, including the names of
  genera established or proposed since the publication of his system. The
  descriptions of established genera have been rendered as concise and
  clear as possible. It is hoped that no essential characters are omitted,
  and that those living authors, whose proposed generic distinctions have
  been passed over in a few words, will not have to complain of want of
  justice in the attempt to interpret their meaning.</p>

  <p>In most cases the generic name will be found accompanied by its
  derivation. This has been done, in the hope of assisting the memory by
  associating the meaning of a term with some peculiarity in the thing
  described. At the end of each description of a genus, some general
  observations occur, pointing out the principal character which
  distinguishes it from others, to which it is nearly allied; and also
  stating the geographical or geological distribution and habits of the
  animal.</p>

  <p>The above descriptions and definitions are illustrated by a series of
  plates, containing above 500 etchings of nearly as many proposed or
  established genera, arranged in Lamarckian order, so as to show at a
  glance all the generic forms of each family. And, although from their
  number, they could not be very highly finished, it is hoped that they
  will be found characteristic.</p>

  <p>The compiler cannot replace his pen without acknowledging, with filial
  gratitude, the kind assistance of one who has sacrificed much of his time
  in bringing his knowledge and experience to bear upon the correctness and
  utility of this humble attempt to remove some of the difficulties to
  which the commencement of this, as well as of every other study, is
  exposed.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION</p>

  <p>The favourable reception and rapid sale of the first edition of the
  Conchological Manual having rendered a second necessary, the Author takes
  this opportunity of explaining the nature of the alterations which have
  been made. In doing this, he has to thank his friends for their
  suggestions, which, together with his own increased knowledge and
  experience, enable him to present a more complete and satisfactory work
  to the scientific public.</p>

  <p>For the further convenience of those who are studying the rudiments of
  the science, an entirely new Introduction is given, in which, commencing
  with the structure and gradual developement of the shell, the author has
  endeavoured to explain the general principles of Conchology in
  systematical order. This Introduction is illustrated by 100 wood-cuts,
  which will be found greatly to assist the Student.</p>

  <p>The definitions have been rendered more full and complete than before,
  and the Author has profited by some manuscript notes communicated by a
  scientific friend, to whom he desires to present his humble
  acknowledgments. Upwards of four hundred explanations have been given of
  words which did not appear in the former edition, three-fourths of which
  are of generic and subgeneric names.</p>

  <p>A large number of notes, referring to the geographical distribution of
  the genera, have been added from the pen of Mr. G. B. Sowerby,
  Senior.</p>

  <p>The plates have been carefully improved; and three, containing upwards
  of eighty figures, have been added.</p>

  <p>On the whole, it will be found that the amount of matter has been
  nearly doubled; all the defects, as far as they have been discovered,
  have been removed, and every means used of making the present edition as
  useful as possible.</p>

<p class="ac lg125">INTRODUCTION.</p>

  <p>The Science of Conchology affords a very delightful and instructive
  amusement for the leisure hours of those who, retiring occasionally from
  the gaieties of fashionable life, seek pleasure in the quiet
  contemplation of some of the smaller, but not less wonderful operations
  of creative wisdom. And, although the study of shells would be more
  complete, and rank higher in the scale of philosophical pursuits, were it
  always accompanied by that of the animal inhabiting them, it nevertheless
  presents means of intellectual gratification, to many who cannot follow
  it beyond the cabinet and the boudoir. These may examine with admiration
  and mental improvement, the beautiful colouring and architecture of these
  wonders of the deep, they may exercise their taste and judgment in the
  selection and arrangement of specimens, and their discrimination in
  detecting and appreciating the distinctions upon which the arrangement is
  founded.</p>

  <p>It is but little that can be known of the subject without forming a
  collection of greater or less extent; for, as it would be uninstructive
  merely to delight the eye with the bright colours and elegant form of
  shells, without possessing correct information respecting them, so it
  would be insipid and useless to learn technicalities without being
  acquainted by personal observation with the subjects to which they are
  applied. The first endeavour should, therefore, be to obtain a few shells
  as examples of the larger divisions, and, when these are understood, to
  proceed with the smaller groups, until a collection be formed to
  represent as many generic forms as possible. It may be as well here to
  advise those who are forming a collection to be very particular in every
  practicable instance to have the shells properly named at the time of
  purchasing; as it will save much trouble, and materially assist in the
  attainment of the desired object. To this end, recourse should be had to
  those naturalist tradesmen, who unite the attainment and diffusion of
  real scientific knowledge with their commercial pursuits.</p>

  <p>Supposing, however, that the person who desires to learn the science,
  possesses a small parcel of unarranged and unnamed shells, without any
  previous acquaintance with the subject, the following introductory
  explanations, are drawn up with the view of enabling him, without further
  assistance, to obtain a general insight into its principles, equal to
  that of those who have studied it long and laboriously. To effect this,
  he must read them, carefully comparing the descriptions with the figures
  referred to, and with the specimens which he may have at command.</p>

  <p>After describing the nature of the science and defining its objects,
  we shall proceed to explain the structure of those objects, and the
  manner of their growth. We shall then enter somewhat minutely into the
  principles of classification, the distinctions upon which they are
  founded, and some of the technical terms used to express them. After
  which we shall pass through the arrangement of Lamarck, defining the
  general divisions adopted under the terms of "<i>Classes</i>,
  <i>Orders</i>, and <i>Families</i>," as far as they are capable of
  definition. The subdivision of the latter into <i>genera</i> will only be
  entered into so far as to enumerate the principal of them, the more
  minute descriptions being reserved for the alphabetical part of the
  work.</p>

  <p>Let none be discouraged by the number of generic distinctions proposed
  and adopted in modern times; for if well defined, they will be found to
  facilitate rather than encumber the science. The knowledge of species
  must be the foundation of every system, and the greater their number, the
  more necessary it becomes to subdivide them; if, for instance, all the
  species now known were to have been included in the 50 genera of Linnæus,
  a single genus would have contained many hundreds of incongruous species,
  in which case it would be much more difficult to remember them, than if
  they were to be divided into a far greater number of genera. Every well
  marked division, however arbitrary its limits, tends to simplify the
  subject, and to facilitate the researches of the student.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">NATURE OF THE SCIENCE.</p>

  <p>Conchology is the study of shells, viewed and described as to what
  they are either in themselves, or in relation to the soft, inarticulate
  animals which produce them, and of which they form a part. These animals
  are called <span class="sc">Mollusca</span>, and perhaps the best general
  description of them will be found in De Blainville's "Manuel de
  Malacologie et de Conchyliologie." The following is a translation,
  "Animal in pairs, the body and its appendages soft, inarticulate (not
  jointed), enveloped in a muscular skin, commonly called the mantle, which
  is extremely variable in form, and has developed either within or upon it
  a calcareous portion, consisting of one or several pieces, commonly
  called a <span class="sm">SHELL</span>."</p>

  <p>The term Mollusca was formerly restricted to those soft animals which
  were destitute of shells, although possessing in other particulars, the
  characters described above, and it was used in order to distinguish them
  from the <span class="sc">Testacea</span>, which were covered or
  internally supported by calcareous parts. In the system of Linnæus, the
  soft portions are first arranged under the general designation of "Vermes
  Mollusca," and described without regard to the presence, absence, or
  character of the shells; and then the shells are separately characterized
  under the appellation of "Vermes Testacea," without any further notice of
  the animal, than an indication of the genus to which it belongs; thus the
  animal of Cypræa is said to be a Limax, and that of Tellina a Tethys.</p>

  <p>The nearest approach to correctness, and the most philosophical method
  of study will be found in the modern system, adopted by Lamarck and his
  followers, of observing these animals as a whole, and arranging them
  according to the assemblage of characters which they present; of course
  taking into consideration the existence or non-existence, form and
  structure of the shell, on the same principle, which, in arranging the
  vertebrated animals would lead us to study the hair, hoof, nails, claws,
  &amp;c. as well as the other parts.</p>

  <p>At the same time, it must be admitted that there are many private
  collectors of Shells who would find it a difficult, if not impossible
  task to study minutely and successfully the soft parts of the Mollusca.
  Ladies, for instance, could not be expected to handle with pleasure and
  perseverance, these fleshy substances, which in order to be preserved
  from putrefaction, must be kept in spirits; and yet such persons may,
  with improvement and advantage to their own minds, enjoy the interesting
  and scientific amusement of studying and arranging the clean and
  beautiful natural objects which are so easily preserved, and so
  exquisitely curious in their structure. Let it also be remembered, that
  if shells had not been rendered commercially valuable, by the zeal and
  emulation manifested by <i>mere</i> Conchologists for the possession of
  rare specimens, few travelling merchants and sea captains would have
  thought them worthy of a corner in their cabins. In this case, few
  specimens being brought to the country, the more Philosophical Naturalist
  would have been left without the means of obtaining materials to work
  upon, or of attracting public attention to his favourite pursuit.</p>

  <p>On account of these and other considerations, it has been thought
  advisable that the present undertaking should bear a purely conchological
  character. The peculiarities of the shells alone being detailed for the
  assistance of those who collect and study them, while at the same time,
  in deciding upon their affinities and places, in the arrangement, it will
  be necessary to take advantage of the conclusion to which those have
  arrived, who have studied the animal in all its parts. And the conviction
  must be expressed, that if ever a complete Natural System shall be formed
  it will result from the labours of the last mentioned class of
  naturalists.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">DEFINITION OF A SHELL.</p>

  <p>Before entering minutely into the description of shells, it will be
  necessary to distinguish from the true testaceous Mollusca two kinds of
  animals which have formerly been associated with them. Of these, the
  first is the class of <span class="sc">Crustacea</span>, consisting of
  crabs, crayfish, &amp;c. These differ from shell-fish, not only in
  structure and chemical composition, but also in the fact that the animal
  has jointed limbs, and that the substance of the flesh is inseparable
  from the hard external covering, which invests each particular joint as
  with a sheath; whereas the Molluscous animal is but partially attached to
  its shell, from which it possesses the power of partly withdrawing and
  returning. The second class is that to which the sea-urchin, or Echinus,
  belongs, of which there are many genera and species. The testaceous
  covering of Echini is composed of a number of small pieces, placed edge
  to edge, forming a more or less globular external covering to the flesh,
  which is supported in the centre by a number of bones leaning upon each
  other in a pyramidal form. The <i>test</i> is of a fibrous texture,
  guarded on the outside with moveable spines, which turn on ball and
  socket joints.</p>

  <p>A true shell is composed of one or more calcareous pieces, commonly
  called valves, each piece formed by a series of layers, applied obliquely
  upon each other, in such a manner that each new layer begins within, and
  terminates a little in advance of the one before it.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">STRUCTURE AND GROWTH.</p>

  <p>We shall now endeavour to describe the manner in which the growth of
  each separate valve, or each regularly formed shell, proceeds from the
  nucleus.</p>

  <p>Before the young animal has left the egg, if it be an <i>oviparous</i>
  species, or the body of the parent if <i>viviparous</i>, the nucleus of
  the shell is generally formed, and specimens are sometimes preserved in
  which the young shell is seen within the egg, as in the cut, fig. 1, 2;
  or adhering to the inner surface of the full-grown shell by the dried
  mucus of the animal, as seen in fig. 3.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:37%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs01-03.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs01-03.png"
      alt="Figs. 1-3." title="Figs. 1-3." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">1. Egg of a Bulinus. 2. The same broken,
    shewing the young shell. 3. The young of a Paludina, as seen in the
    aperture of the shell.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In both cases, the nucleus is generally of a more horny and
  transparent composition than the parts subsequently produced. As soon as
  the animal is hatched, or, in other words, leaves the egg or body of the
  parent, of course it begins to increase in size, and to require a
  corresponding enlargement in the shell. To effect this, a small quantity
  of mucus substance, secreted by the mantle of the animal, is deposited on
  the edge of the aperture. When this is dry and become sufficiently hard,
  it is lined by a more calcareous secretion; and these together form a new
  layer, which is followed by others in succession; each new layer being
  larger than the one that preceded it until the whole being complete, the
  full-grown animal is invested with a shell commensurate with its own
  proportions. Thus from the apex or nucleus the formation proceeds, as it
  were, downwards, taking the shape of the part which secretes it, on which
  it is in a manner moulded.</p>

  <p>The nucleus, or first formed portion, may for technical purposes be
  considered, mathematically, as the apex of a spiral cone. And here it
  must be observed, that whether the shell consist of one or several
  pieces, each piece has a separate nucleus, and the process of formation
  is separately repeated with each. The word cone is used for convenience,
  and its meaning extended so as to include all those structures which
  commencing at a point enlarge downwards.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:17%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig04.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig04.png"

    <p style="text-align:center">4. Imaginary cone. <i>a.</i> Apex.
    <i>b.</i> Base. <i>l.</i> Lines of growth.</p>
  </div>

  <p>From the apex, the next layer is deposited on its edge, and advancing
  beyond it necessarily adds to its extent. Thus, suppose for the sake of
  illustration, the part marked <i>a</i> in the diagram, fig. 4, to
  represent a nucleus, the cross lines (<i>l</i>) will shew the consecutive
  layers, which enlarge their circle as they add to their numbers. This
  disposition of shelly matter into layers is marked externally by
  concentric striæ, or <i>lines of growth</i>, while on the inside the
  edges of the laminæ are consolidated into a kind of enamel. If a
  perpendicular section of a solid portion of a shell were magnified, it
  would present, in many instances, an appearance resembling the diagram,
  fig. 5; <i>a</i> may be taken to represent the horny part of the layers
  which form the outer coating, named "<i>Periostaca</i>," or
  "<i>Epidermis</i>;" the undulating line <i>b</i>, is formed by the edges
  of the calcareous layers, and causes the striæ, or lines of growth, which
  are often distinguishable on the surface of the shell; the space <i>c</i>
  is the middle part of those layers, and at <i>d</i> they are consolidated

  <p>In some species the layers are irregularly grouped together, and their
  edges overlap each other, so that they are easily separable, and
  advancing beyond each other, give a leafy appearance to the external
  surface. This structure is termed <i>foliaceous</i>. A very familiar
  instance of this may be observed in the common oyster. If a specimen of
  this shell be broken, the substance will be seen to exhibit a degree of
  looseness, and a magnifying glass will enable the student to trace
  distinctly the laminæ of which it is composed. The accompanying

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CLASSIFICATION.</p>

  <p>The classification of shells, that is, their systematic arrangement
  into <i>classes</i>, <i>orders</i>, <i>families</i>, <i>genera</i> and
  <i>species</i>, cannot be made to depend entirely upon the characters
  observable in them, viewed by themselves; for this reason, that many
  similarly formed shells form the habitations of animals perfectly
  distinct, and that many molluscous animals are found to agree with each
  other in every respect but in the form of their testaceous support. There
  are, however, many important distinctions to be observed in the shells
  themselves, leading to the establishment of many of those very divisions,
  which would afterwards be confirmed by an examination of the soft parts.
  It is necessary to attend, as far as means and opportunity will allow, to
  <i>all</i> the points of difference, both in the shell and in the animal,
  in order to form, and in some instances even to appreciate, a generic or
  larger distinction. It will therefore be our endeavour to explain the
  general principles upon which those distinctions are formed, and the
  manner in which they are applied and expressed in detail by scientific
  writers.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">NUMBER OF PIECES, OR INDEPENDENTLY FORMED PARTS.</p>

  <p>The first, most simple and obvious division of shells, is that which
  results from the number of separate pieces composing them. Hence the
  distinction implied by the terms <span class="sm">UNIVALVE</span>, or
  consisting of a single piece; <span class="sm">BIVALVE</span>, or
  composed of two pieces; and <span class="sm">MULTIVALVE</span>, or
  composed of more than two. For an example of <i>univalve</i>, take a
  common whelk; for a <i>bivalve</i>, take a muscle or a scallop; and for a
  <i>multivalve</i>, the barnacle, or balanus, found adhering to the common
  oyster.</p>

  <p>But although this arrangement may appear at first sight perfectly easy
  and plain, some explanation will be necessary in order to guard the
  student against understanding the above expressions in their strictest
  sense, without qualification. Thus the univalves are said to consist of a
  single piece, or spiral cone; but it would be more correct to speak of
  this piece as forming either the whole or the principal part of the
  shell: for there is in many instances, a much smaller flattened piece
  attached to the foot of the animal, which being drawn in when it retires,
  closes the aperture as with a kind of door, to which in fact the word
  valve might be very properly applied; it is called however the <span
  class="sm">OPERCULUM</span>, and the little horny plate, frequently drawn
  out by means of a pin from the aperture of a periwinkle, will present a
  familiar example.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:35%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig07.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig07.png"
      alt="Fig. 7." title="Fig. 7." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">Accessary valves of a Pholas.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The same may be said respecting the bivalves; for besides the
  principal portions or valves of which the shell is composed, there are in
  many species, one or two smaller separate portions, named "<i>accessary
  plates</i>" by some authors. They are fixed by means of cartilages, on
  the back of the hinge.&mdash;The engraving, fig. 7, represents the
  accessary valves of a species of Pholas, which was on this account
  arranged by Linnæus with the Multivalves. Nearly allied to the Pholades
  is a set of shells to which De Blainville has given the name
  "<i>Tubicolæ</i>," or inhabitants of tubes. In this case, the bivalve
  shell is connected with a testaceous tube or pipe, to which it is
  attached either by one or by both valves, or in which it lies attached
  only by the cartilages of the animal. In the genus Aspergillum, the two
  small valves are soldered into the sides of the tube in such a manner as
  to constitute a part of it. One of these shells, called the Water-spout,
  might be taken up by a person not aware of its real nature, and regarded
  as a pipe or tube prettily fringed, and nothing more; but upon a closer
  examination, he would find the two valves, the points of which are
  visible from the outside of the tube.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">HABITS&mdash;<i>Land, Fresh-water, or Marine Shells.</i></p>

  <p>Another distinction, leading to important results in classification,
  is that which is derived from the nature of the element breathed by the
  Mollusc. And although this consideration belongs more especially to the
  study of the animal itself, yet the habits of the animal materially
  influence the structure of the shell.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Terrestrial</span> or <span
  class="sc">Land</span> Molluscs live on land, breathe air, and feed on
  plants and trees.&mdash;Those who find pleasure in horticultural pursuits
  will at once call to mind a too familiar example of these Molluscs in the
  common garden snail. The Land-shells are all univalves, and constitute a
  family in the Lamarckian system under the name "<i>Colimacea</i>," or
  snails, corresponding with the Linnean genus Helix.&mdash;They are
  generally light in structure and simple in form.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Aquatic</span>, or Fresh-water Molluscs, such as
  the Planorbis, commonly called the Fresh-water Snail; the
  Unio&mdash;known by the name of Fresh-water Muscle, is found in ponds,
  ditches and rivers. The <i>epidermis</i> of these is generally of a
  thick, close-grained character, and they are subject to corrosion near
  the umbones. There are but few genera of fresh-water shells besides the
  Uniones, among bivalves, and the "Melaniana" among univalves. Concerning
  the former it may be observed, that they are all pearly within, and the
  colour of the thick horny coating embraces all the varieties of brownish
  and yellowish green.</p>

  <p>The <span class="sc">Marine</span>, or <i>sea-shells</i>, belong to
  all the classes and orders, and include by far the greater number of
  species. They vary in the habits of the animal, and consequently in the
  situations in which they are found. Some are found buried in sand and
  marine mud, and are named "<i>Arenicolæ</i>" or inhabitants of sand;
  others in holes of rocks and other hard substances, then they are named
  "<i>Petricolæ</i>,"&mdash;some of these latter form the holes in which
  they live by corroding or eating away the stone. A section of these form
  the family of "<i>Lithophagidæ</i>," or stone-eaters, of Lamarck. Others,
  again, take up their parasitical abode in the bodies of animals, and feed
  upon their substance; as for instance, the Stylifer, which is found in
  the vital part of star-fish, and Coronula, and Tubicinella, found buried
  in the skin of the whale.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">LOCOMOTION&mdash;<i>Attached, Unattached.</i></p>

  <p>A much more subordinate source of distinction arises from the freedom
  or attachment of the shells. Some of them float or walk freely in their
  natural element; others are fixed or attached to foreign bodies. Among
  those which are attached, there is again a difference as to the mode of
  attachment. Some are united to foreign bodies by means of a glutinating
  substance, secreted by the animal, and joining part of the surface of the
  shell to that of the stone, coral, or other substance. In this way shells
  are fixed to each other in groups; this is the case with the Spondyli
  among bivalves, and the Serpulæ among univalves. M. de Blainville applies
  the term "<i>Fixæ</i>" to these shells. Others are kept in a particular
  place by means of a <i>Byssus</i> or Tendinous fibrous line or bunch of
  silky hairs, acting as a cable, and allowing the Mollusc to ride as it
  were at anchor. This Tendon is connected with some part of the animal
  from which it passes through an opening or hiatus in the shell, as in the
  Terebratula and the Mytilus.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:42%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs08-09.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs08-09.png"
      alt="Figs. 8-9." title="Figs. 8-9." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the former, represented by the cut, fig. 8, the tendon passes
  through a perforation in the upper valve; and in the latter, Mytilus,
  fig. 9, the byssus passes out between the valves.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to explain the characters of the different groups,
  according to the modern system of classification, it may be desirable to
  explain the terms by which the different parts and characters are
  described, and to shew the manner in which the shells are measured. For
  this purpose we shall treat of the general divisions separately. We begin
  with</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">UNIVALVE SHELLS.</p>

  <p>In considering Univalves merely with reference to their mathematical
  construction, the first point demanding our attention is, whether they
  are symmetrical or non-symmetrical, or, in other words, whether a
  straight line drawn through the shell would divide it into two equal
  parts. The greater part of univalves are non-symmetrical, being rolled
  obliquely on the axis; but many are symmetrical, being rolled
  horizontally on the axis. The Nautilus presents an illustration of the
  latter; the Snail is a familiar example of the former.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Symmetrical Univalves.</i></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs10-11.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs10-11.png"
      alt="Figs. 10-11." title="Figs. 10-11." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In describing these it will be well to commence with the most simple
  form, such as the Patella,&mdash;taking a conical species as an example.
  In this it will be observed that there is no winding or curvature, but a
  simple depressed cone, and that the line <i>a</i>, <i>p</i>, divides it
  into two equal parts.</p>

  <p>The <i>anterior</i>, <i>a</i>, (<i>cut</i>, fig. 10) is known by the
  interruption of the muscular impression which surrounds the central disc
  (<i>d.</i>) This interruption of the muscular impression is in the place
  where the head of the animal lies in the shell. The impression itself is
  caused by the fibrous muscle which attaches the animal to the shell. The
  apex (<i>a</i>) in Patella, generally leans towards the anterior
  (<i>a</i>) part of the shell, and away from the posterior (<i>p</i>); and
  this circumstance has caused some mistakes, because in Emarginula the
  apex leans towards the posterior; and students, instead of examining the
  muscular impression, which is the only criterion, have only noticed the
  direction in which the apex turned, and concluded that to be the
  anterior, towards which it inclined. The lines or ribs running from the
  base to the apex of the shell, in the direction <i>r</i>, are called
  <i>radiating</i> lines; and those which encircle the cone in the
  direction <i>c c</i>, from front to back, are very properly described as
  <i>concentric</i>. The <i>length</i> is measured from front to back in
  the line <i>e</i>; the breadth, from side to side, in the line <i>b</i>;
  and the depth from the apex to the base.</p>

  <p>Let it be observed that patelliform, or limpet-shaped shells are not
  all symmetrical; Umbrella, Siphonaria, Ancylus, &amp;c. will form
  exceptions, of which we have yet to speak. And the learner may also be
  reminded that the Limpets themselves are not <i>all</i> regular in their
  form: for as they adhere to rocks and other rough surfaces, and are so
  little locomotive, in many instances they partake of the inequalities of
  the surface, and conform to its irregularities. This adherence is not
  effected by any agglutinating power in the animal, nor by any tendinous
  process like that described above; but simply by means of the foot of the
  animal acting as a sucker.</p>

  <p>The next variation in symmetrical univalves is to be observed in the
  tubular, curved form, the example of which will be the Dentalium, fig.
  12.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:49%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig12.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig12.png"
      alt="Fig. 12." title="Fig. 12." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">Dentalium Elephantinum.</p>
  </div>

  <p>This has an opening at the anterior termination <i>a</i>, called the
  aperture. The opening at the posterior end (<i>p</i>) is named a fissure,
  or perforation. The ribs running along the sides of the shell are
  <i>longitudinal</i>, or radiating. And the lines round the circumference
  are <i>lines of growth</i>, or <i>concentric</i>&mdash;each one having in
  succession, at earlier stages of growth, formed the aperture. They are
  described as concentric, or transverse.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Symmetrical Convolute Univalves.</i></p>

  <p>The Nautilus, the Spirula, the Scaphite, and the Ammonite are the
  leading types of this form; but when we use the term symmetrical, in
  reference to these, the word must not be understood in its strictest
  sense, for no shell is <i>perfectly</i> symmetrical: but it means that
  there is no perceptible difference in the proportion of the two sides; as
  in the human body, the right side is larger and more powerful than the
  left, yet to a degree so small that it gives no apparent bias to the
  figure.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">CHAMBERED SHELLS.</p>

  <p>Many of the shells now under consideration are chambered, that is, the
  internal cavity is divided into separate compartments by plates reaching
  across it, named <i>Septa</i>; and the only connection between the
  chambers is formed by the small pipes passing through them, to which the
  name of Siphon is attached.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Septa.</i></p>

  <p>The septa are <i>simple</i> in some species, as in the Nautilus, fig.
  13. In others they are <i>undulated</i>, having waved edges, as in some
  species of Ammonites; in others they are <i>angulated</i>, as in
  Goniatites, fig. 480 in the plates; and in the greater number of
  instances, among the Ammonites, they are <i>arborescent</i>, or
  branched.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:48%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs13-15.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs13-15.png"
      alt="Figs. 13-15." title="Figs. 13-15." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">13. Section of Nautilus.&mdash;14.
    Undulating Septa.&mdash;15. Arborescent Septa.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In the above section of a Nautilus, fig. 13, diminished in size,
  showing the whorls and chambers (<i>c</i>), it will be seen that the
  edges of the septa (<i>s</i>) are formed in one simple curve. In fig. 14,
  the upper part of an Ammonite, the undulating line will be seen; and in
  fig. 15 a specimen is given of the arborescent septa.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Siphon.</i></p>

  <p>The Siphon is <i>dorsal</i> when placed near the outside of the
  whorls; <i>central</i> when near the middle; and <i>ventral</i> when near
  the inside of the whorl, or that part which leans against the last
  volution. When it passes uninterruptedly from one chamber to another, it
  is described as <i>continuous</i>, as in the case of Spirula; when, on
  the other hand, it only passes through the septum a little distance, and
  opens into the chamber, as in Nautilus, it is <i>discontinuous</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Whorls of Symmetrical Univalves.</i></p>

  <p>They are <i>disunited</i> when they do not touch each other, as in the
  case of Spirula (fig. 471 in the plates); but in the contrary case they
  are said to be <i>contiguous</i>. In some species of Nautilus the whorls
  overwrap each other in such a manner that the early whorls are entirely
  covered by the last, the edges of which reach to the centre of the disk:
  the spire is then said to be <i>hidden</i>; as in the Nautilus Pompilius.
  In Nautilus umbilicatus the spire is nearly hidden, the whorls not quite
  covering each other; but in the greater number of the Ammonites, the
  largest part of the preceding whorls is seen. To express the degree in
  which the whorls overwrap each other, has caused much difficulty in
  concise descriptions. Perhaps it would be well to apply the term
  <i>spiral disc</i> to so much of the shell as is seen besides the last
  whorl, and to describe it as large or small in diameter, compared with
  the whole: or to say that the whorls of the spire are half, or one-third,
  or one-fourth covered, as the case may be.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Aperture of Symmetrical Univalves.</i></p>

  <p>In Ammonites Blagdeni and some others the aperture is of an oblong
  square; it is then said to be <i>sub-quadrated</i>; in Nautilus
  triangularis it is <i>angulated</i>; in Ammonites Greenoughi it is of an
  interrupted oval shape, described as <i>elliptical</i>. In the greater
  number of Orthocerata, it is rounded or <i>circular</i>. The entrance of
  the last whorl into the aperture of some rounded species of Nautilus
  causes it to take a <i>semi-lunar</i> form; if rounded at the sides it is
  said to be reniform or kidney-shaped; if pointed at the sides it is
  <i>semi-lunar</i>; and in some species of Ammonites, it is five-sided or
  <i>quinque-lateral</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Measurement of Symmetrical Conical Univalves.</i></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:41%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig16.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig16.png"
      alt="Fig. 16." title="Fig. 16." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The <i>width</i> is measured across the aperture, which is the widest
  part of the shell. The <i>length</i> (<i>l</i>) from the dorsal part
  (<i>d</i>) of the aperture to the dorsal part of the <i>whorl</i>
  (<i>d</i>) on the opposite part of the shell. The <i>ventral</i> part of
  the whorls is that nearest to the axis, and the <i>dorsal</i> that which
  forms the outline of the figure.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">NON-SYMMETRICAL UNIVALVES.</p>

  <p>These are <i>conical</i>, <i>irregular</i>, <i>spiral</i>, or
  <i>convolute</i>. The <i>conical</i> form is when there is no enrolment
  of the apex. Although the Patellæ were described as symmetrical, there
  are several species of Patelliform shells which are not symmetrical. In
  Umbrella, for instance, the apex is oblique, the shells being placed
  obliquely on the animal. In the genus <i>Siphonaria</i>, there is a
  groove on one side, where the brachia or gills of the animal rest. In the
  genus Ancylus, it will be observed that the apex bends on one side, and
  the animal is like the Limnæa, which has a spiral shell. The cup and
  saucer Limpets, or Calyptrædæ, present a group which requires to be
  described, differently from the symmetrical or true Limpets. Their
  structure is very curious, and they vary considerably among themselves,
  some of them being simply conical, others nearly flat, or discoidal, and
  others more or less spiral. But their principal peculiarity consists in
  their having a small internal process or plate variously shaped, commonly
  named their <i>septum</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Septa of Limpets.</i></p>

  <p>The septa of Limpets assume a variety of forms, the principal of which
  will be seen in the accompanying engravings.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:49%;">

      alt="Figs. 17-20." title="Figs. 17-20." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The form from which the group derives its generic appellation is that
  of the cup-shaped or <i>Cyathiform</i> species (fig. 17). In the
  Crepidulæ, or Slipper-Limpets, the septum is flat, reaching across the
  opening, like the deck of a vessel; it is then described as
  <i>transverse</i> (fig. 20). In Calyptræa Equestris, it has two prominent
  points, and is described as <i>bi-furcated</i> (fig. 18). In another
  species, it is a three-sided plate rather spiral at the apex (fig.
  19).</p>

  </div>
  <p>The line marked <i>a</i>, <i>p</i>, <i>ll</i> indicates the direction
  in which the shell is to be measured for <i>length</i>. <i>a</i>
  indicates the <i>anterior</i>, <i>p</i> the <i>posterior</i>. The line
  <i>d</i> (fig. 23), from the apex to the base, is the <i>depth</i>. The
  line <i>b</i> (fig. 28), is in the direction of the breadth.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Irregular non-symmetrical Univalves.</i></p>

  <p>Serpuliform shells are irregularly twisted (<i>tortuous</i>) hollow
  tubes, which were formerly considered to have been secreted by a kind of
  worm, but now known to be the shells of true Molluscs, of a kind not very
  widely differing from those which have regularly spiral shells. The
  greater part of these are attached to foreign bodies, or to each other in
  groups. Some are attached by the whole length of the shell, they are then
  said to be <i>decumbent</i>. Some of these are coiled round like the
  Spirorbis, the little white shell seen on the carapace of the Lobster or
  on leaves of sea-weeds; they are then said to be discoidal; others again,
  such as the <i>Vermetus</i>, approach more nearly to the spiral form. The
  deviation from the regular spire only taking place after the few first
  volutions.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">SPIRAL NON-SYMMETRICAL UNIVALVES.</p>

  <p>As these constitute the largest class, it will be necessary to dwell
  upon them in detail. First as to <i>measurement</i>.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:21%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig24.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig24.png"
      alt="Fig. 24." title="Fig. 24." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The length is measured from the apex, to that part of the aperture
  <i>a</i> (fig. 24), at the greatest distance from it. The <i>breadth</i>
  is in the opposite direction. The <i>anterior</i>, or front part of the
  aperture, is marked <i>a</i>, where the head of the animal protrudes.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Spire of non-symmetrical Univalves.</i></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:49%;">

    27, 28, <i>decollated</i>; 29, <i>concave</i>; 30, <i>papillary</i>;
    31, <i>mammellated</i>; 32, <i>discoidal</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>In counting the whorls of which the spire consists, we commence at the
  apex, and reckon downwards to the last, or body whorl. The spire is
  described as being long or short in relation to the aperture: in which
  case, all that is above the aperture is measured with the spire. Its apex
  requires particular notice, as the character of the whole shell
  frequently depends upon the particulars observable in this part. It is
  sometimes <i>obtuse</i>, or blunt; sometimes <i>acute</i>, or sharp. In
  the Cones it is frequently flat, and in Planorbis it is concave. It is
  sometimes of a different structure from the rest of the shell, retaining
  the horny and transparent appearance which characterized it when the
  animal was first hatched. The Tritons present an instance of this,
  although it is not always observable, owing to the tenderness of the
  substances which causes it to break or fall away in many specimens. A
  very remarkable instance also occurs in Bulinus decollatus (cut, fig. 27,
  28), so named, because the apex, to the depth of several whorls, falls
  off, and the shell is <i>decollated</i>. In this, and many more
  instances, among Pupæform land shells, the occurrence of this
  circumstance seems to be by no means rare or accidental, a provision
  having been made for filling up the opening by a septum. A <i>papillary
  apex</i> is one which is swelled at the extremity into a little rounded
  nob, or nipple; and a <i>mammellated</i> apex is one which is rounded out
  more fully into the shape of a teat.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Whorls.</i></p>

  <p>The spire is described as consisting of <i>numerous</i> or <i>few</i>
  whorls, and sometimes the number of them is particularly stated. A whorl
  consists of one turn of the spiral cone. The whorls are described as
  <i>flattened</i>, when the sides are not bulged out so as to cause the
  outline of the spire to deviate considerably from straightness: when the
  contrary is the case, the whorls are said to be <i>ventricose</i>, and
  either <i>rounded</i> or <i>angulated</i>. The degree of rapidity with
  which the whorls become enlarged presents an important source of
  distinction. The <i>suture</i>, or seam, which separates one whorl from
  another is also noticed as being <i>distinct</i> or otherwise;
  <i>canaliculated</i>, or grooved; or covered by an enamel, which in some
  instances is swelled into a ridge or <i>tumid</i>.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Varices.</i></p>

  <p>Varices are caused by periodical rests or stoppages in the growth of
  the shell, when the edge of the aperture thickens, and renders the shell
  as complete as when full grown. Again, after an interval, another check
  takes place, and another thickened edge is formed, and so on in
  succession, until the animal arrives at maturity, and the shell is
  full-grown. The thickened edges successively forming the aperture, remain
  visible on the outside, through all the subsequent stages. When these
  rests take place at frequent periods, the varices will of course be
  numerous as in Harpa and Scalaria. They occur at regular or irregular
  distances, varying in shape and other characters. When the varices occur
  at regular intervals, and form a connected ridge from whorl to whorl up
  the spire, they are said to be <i>continuous</i>, as in Ranella; when on
  the contrary, the varix on one whorl does not come in contact with that
  on the other, they are described as <i>discontinuous</i>. In order to
  distinguish a regular varix from a mere external ridge, it will be
  sufficient to notice whether its edge overlaps the external surface, and
  whether it resembles the open edge of the aperture, which true varices
  do.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Aperture.</i></p>

  <p>The aperture or opening of the spiral tube, was formerly described as
  the mouth; a term calculated to convey an erroneous impression, when
  applied to a part of the shell which has no correspondence with the mouth
  of the animal. The word <i>aperture</i> is used by modern writers in a
  general sense, including the cavity, its edge, and the canals. The cavity
  itself is distinguished in various shells as to its shape, which depends
  much upon the degree of modification produced by the last whorl. In some
  cases, as in Cyclostoma, where the aperture stands apart from the last
  whorl, the shape is round, or nearly so. The Scalaria presents a good
  example of this. In others, where the inner edge or lip, wrapping over
  the body whorl is nearly straight, the aperture is <i>semi-lunar</i>, or
  half-moon shaped: this is remarkable in the "<i>Neritacea</i>" of
  Lamarck, named, on that account, "<i>hemi-cyclostomata</i>" by De
  Blainville. In a great number of instances, the lower part of the body
  whorl enters obliquely into the upper part of the aperture, the result
  being a <i>pyriform</i>, or pear-shaped opening. The aperture is
  described as <i>long</i> when it is largest in the direction of the axis,
  and <i>wide</i>, in the contrary case. The <i>anterior</i> is the part at
  the greatest distance from the apex, and the body whorl; the
  <i>posterior</i>, the part nearest to the apex. Thus some apertures are
  described as <i>posteriorly contracted</i> and <i>anteriorly widened</i>,
  or the reverse. A <i>linear</i> aperture is one contracted in its whole
  length, as in Cypræa. When the whorls are angulated, a <i>trigonal</i>
  aperture is the result, as in many species of Trochus. Some are
  <i>transversely oval</i>, that is in an opposite direction to the axis,
  and others <i>longitudinally oval</i>. When the whorls are formed with
  two outer angles, a somewhat quadrated aperture is formed. There are
  other variations too numerous to mention.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The entire edge of the aperture described generally, is named the
  Peritrême, but this term can only be conveniently applied in cases where,
  in some at least of its characters, it is the same all round, so that one
  descriptive term is applicable to the whole. As, however, this is of rare
  occurrence, it is found convenient in descriptions to separate the rim
  from the outer lip. In a great number of instances, this is done
  naturally, by a canal, or notch at the anterior or lower extremity, and
  by the posterior union of that part which overlays the body whorl with
  the other portion. At these two points the outer and inner lips separate
  from each other: we therefore describe the</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Canals of the Aperture.</i></p>

  <p>When there is neither notch nor canal, anteriorly or posteriorly,
  interrupting the edge of the aperture, it is described as entire. When
  there is a notch or sinus at the anterior extremity, it is said to be
  <i>emarginated</i>. When the edge of this notch is expanded, and drawn
  out in the form of a beak, it is said to be <i>canaliferous</i>, or to
  have a <i>canal</i>. When, in addition to this, the lips are thickened
  and contracted posteriorly near their junction, and drawn out so as to
  form a groove, it is said to be <i>bi-canaliculated</i>, or to have two
  canals. The <i>anterior canal</i> is said to be long or short, according
  to the proportion which it may bear to the rest of the shell. Thus the
  canal of Ranella ranina (fig. 393 in the plates), may be described as
  <i>short</i>; while that of Murex haustellum, (fig. 396, pl.) is
  <i>long</i>. When it is wide near the aperture, and becomes gradually
  contracted towards its termination, it is said to be <i>tapering</i>, as
  in Pyrula (fig. 388, pl.); when the termination is sudden, it is
  described as <i>truncated</i>. If, on placing the shell upon a plane,
  with the aperture downwards, the canal is seen to rise upwards, it is
  <i>recurved</i>. In Buccinum and Nassa it is turned suddenly over the
  back, and forms a short, curved elevation; it is then described as
  <i>recurved</i> and <i>varicose</i>. If the edges meet, so as to form a
  tube, it is said to be closed, as in some species of Murex and Typhis.
  The posterior canal is, in some cases, <i>free</i>, or standing out from
  the spire, as in some species of Ranellæ; while in others it is
  <i>decumbent</i>, running up the sides of the spire, as in Rostellaria
  (fig. 402, pl.).</p>

  </div>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Lips, or edges of the Aperture.</i></p>

  <p>The part of the edge of the aperture next to the body whorl is named
  the <i>inner</i>, or <i>columellar</i> lip. Posteriorly it commences at
  the point of union with the outer lip, where that touches the body whorl,
  the junction being generally marked by an angle, and sometimes by a
  canal. Anteriorly it terminates where there is generally seen a notch or
  canal, or sudden angle, from which the outer lip proceeds. The part which
  setting out from the body whorl, and proceeds outwards at a distance from
  the axis, till it reaches the anterior canal or notch (or its place in
  case of absence) is named the <i>outer lip</i>. In many cases the edges
  are united in such a manner, that it is difficult to distinguish where
  the inner lip terminates, and the outer lip commences: when this is the
  case, it is usual to describe the margin or peritrême, as a whole,
  without distinguishing the parts. The <i>outer</i> lip, sometimes called
  the right lip, or <i>labrum</i> of continental writers, is sometimes
  acute, not being of thicker substance than the remainder of the shell. In
  other cases it is <i>obtuse</i>, or thickened and rounded at the edge.
  When thickened and turned backwards it is described as <i>reflected</i>;
  when, on the other hand, it is turned inwards towards the axis, as in the
  Cyprædæ, it is <i>inflected</i>, or involute. When it is <i>toothed</i>,
  a distinction must be observed as to whether the dentations are external
  or internal. If the teeth are small and numerous, it is
  <i>denticulated</i>; if larger, it is <i>dentated</i>; when expanded into
  a kind of wing, as in some species of Strombus and Rostellaria, it is
  described as <i>alated</i>; and a family in Lamarck's system is named
  "Alatæ," from this very circumstance. In some of those which are
  expanded, the expansion is divided into separate, attenuated portions,
  they are then said to be digitated.</p>

  </div>

  <p>The <i>inner</i> lip, sometimes named the <i>columellar</i> lip, or
  "<i>labium</i>," is subject to similar variations as to thickness,
  dentition, &amp;c. That portion of it which lies upon the body-whorl is
  frequently distinguished from that which intervenes between it and the
  notch or canal. De Blainville, restricting the term <i>lip</i> "bord
  gauche" to the former portion, applies the term "columella" to the
  latter; and in some instances this may be the more convenient method of
  describing the part in question. The columellar lip is sometimes
  <i>detached</i> entirely from the body of the shell, as in Murex
  haustellum; in others it is <i>decumbent</i>, or lying over the last
  whorl, although quite distinct, and in some cases, <i>thickened</i>,
  <i>callous</i>, or <i>tumid</i>.</p>

  <p>At the lower or anterior part, sometimes called the <i>columella</i>,
  there are in many instances flattened, laminated folds; these are
  particularly conspicuous in the genera Cymba and Melo, where, being
  obliquely spiral and laminar, they are extremely elegant, presenting to
  the eye graduated repetitions of the line of beauty. In other cases, as
  in the Turbinellæ, they are more horizontal and thickened.</p>

  <p>In some cases the columella is swelled into a varicose mass; as in
  Oliva, Ancillaria, &amp;c.; it is then described as <i>tumid</i> or
  varicose. It is sometimes <i>tortuous</i>, and sometimes straight, and is
  susceptible of many variations, too minute and particular to be described
  in this part of the work.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">OPERCULUM.</p>

  <p>The aperture of many species of shells remains constantly open; but in
  a great number of species it is occasionally closed, whenever the animal
  is retracted within the shell, by a calcareous or horny piece called the
  operculum. This must be distinguished in the first instance from another
  kind of calcareous covering, which in some univalve shells serves to
  close the aperture during a certain portion of the year. This piece,
  named the <i>epiphragm</i>, although hardened and shelly in appearance,
  is no real part of the animal or of the shell; being only a secretion
  temporarily hardened, for the purpose of defending the animal from
  external influences during the <i>hibernating</i> or <i>torpid</i>
  season, to be dissolved when that season is at an end. On examining this
  piece, it will be observed that it is not formed in regular layers like
  the rest of the shell; while the true operculum is of a regularly
  laminated structure, having a nucleus and receiving obliquely deposited
  additions, either in a lateral spiral or concentric direction. It is
  attached to the posterior part of the foot on the upper surface; and when
  the animal retires within its shell, that part of the foot enters last,
  drawing the operculum after it, and thus closing the aperture.</p>

  <p>The opercula of various shells differ in the first place as to their
  chemical composition. They are <i>calcareous</i> when formed principally
  of calcareous matter, like the rest of the shell, as in Neritina, Nerita,
  and some others. They are <i>corneo-calcareous</i>, when upon an internal
  lamina of horny consistency there is a thickened layer of shelly matter.
  This is the case with shells of the genus Turbo and Phasianella, which
  are on this account distinguished from those of the genus Trochus; the
  opercula of the latter being horny or <i>corneus</i>.</p>

  <p>The size of the operculum is distinguished by comparison with the rest
  of the shell; thus, those of Strombus, Cassis, &amp;c. are small; while
  those of Cyclostoma and others are large, filling up the cavity at its
  outer edge.</p>

  <p>The direction in which the successive layers are deposited, forms
  another ground of distinction. The disc is formed in some instances of a
  series of whorls, the apex or nucleus being more or less central; if
  these whorls are numerous, the operculum is described as
  <i>multispiral</i>, as in shells of the genus Trochus; if few, as in
  Cyclostoma, it is <i>paucispiral</i>. In some instances the flattened
  spire consists of but one whorl, it is then <i>unispiral</i>; and when
  scarcely one turn is completed, it is described as <i>subspiral</i>. When
  the layers are applied upon each other in such a manner that the nucleus
  is central, and the edges of the subsequent layers are extended beyond
  each other all around, so as to form rims, the operculum is described as
  <i>concentric</i>; if the nucleus is lateral, or at one side without
  being spiral, it is <i>lammellated</i>; and when it forms a terminal
  point, enlarging in the form of a finger-nail or claw, it is
  <i>unguiculated</i>. In the operculum of a Neritina, there is a lateral
  process, by means of which it is locked into the columella, the term
  <i>articulated</i> is then applied. In that of Navicella, there is also a
  process which appears to radiate from the nucleus, it has therefore been
  described as a <i>radiated</i> operculum.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">BIVALVE SHELLS.</p>

  <p>Bivalve shells, named Conchacea by Lamarck, are those which consist of
  two principal portions united to and folded upon each other by means of a
  hinge. The pieces united compose the shell, while each piece separately
  is called a valve. Considering the bivalve shell as a whole, it will be
  necessary, in the first instance, to describe the position in which it is
  to be observed, in order to give the student a clearly defined notion of
  what is intended, when terms expressive of height, depth, length,
  breadth, &amp;c. are used, as well as when the anterior and posterior
  extremities are spoken of. For this purpose, we must suppose the animal
  to be living and creeping along the bed of the sea by means of its foot;
  where this foot protrudes, will be the <i>ventral margin</i>, and the
  opposite part the <i>dorsal margin</i> of the shell. There will then be a
  valve on each side; and if we further suppose the animal to be walking
  forward with its back to the observer, the <i>right</i> and <i>left</i>
  valves will correspond with his right and left sides.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Measurements.</i></p>

  </div>
  <p>The <i>length</i> will be measured from <i>anterior</i> (<i>a</i>) to
  <i>posterior</i> (<i>p</i>), and the lines of growth running in the same
  direction will consequently be <i>longitudinal</i> or <i>concentric</i>;
  <i>transverse</i> of some authors. The height will be from the umbones
  (<i>u</i>), to the <i>ventral margin</i>, and lines or bands in that
  direction are termed <i>radiating</i>; longitudinal, according to some
  authors.</p>

  <p>The points from which the growth of the shell commences, are called
  the <i>umbones</i>; these usually turn towards the anterior part of the
  shell: if this circumstance fails to point out the anterior, it may in
  many cases be distinguished by the muscular impressions of the mantle. If
  this has a sinus or winding, it is always near the posterior muscular
  impression; and in all cases where there is an external ligament, it is
  on the posterior side.</p>

  <p>There is sometimes an impression near the front of the umbones, which
  forms a semicircle on each valve; the space within this semicircle is
  called the <i>lunule</i> (wood-cut, fig. 71 and 72, <i>l. l. l.</i>); a
  corresponding depression, when it exists on the posterior margin near the
  umbones, is named the escutcheon.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Hinge.</i></p>

  </div>

  <p>The <i>hinge</i> of the shell is on the <i>dorsal</i> margin, and is
  composed of the various apparatus by which the two valves act upon each
  other in opening and shutting. It consists of a <i>ligament</i>, which is
  placed on the dorsal margin, just at the back of the umbones, and unites
  the two valves together; the <i>cartilage</i> or thick gristly elastic
  substance, sometimes found close to the <i>ligament</i>, to which it then
  forms an inner coating, and sometimes received into a pit within the
  shell. It serves the purpose of keeping the shell open when not forcibly
  closed by the adductor muscles. An inner layer of shelly matter upon
  which are placed teeth, and pits to receive them on the two valves
  reciprocally. Each of these it will be necessary to treat of more at
  large; observing, at the same time, that in some species of Bivalves
  these parts may be wholly or partially wanting. Thus we meet with some
  shells, such as the Muscle, without teeth; and there is the group
  containing Pholas, &amp;c. the hinge of which is destitute of teeth and
  ligament, the two valves being kept together by loose cartilages, and by
  the contracted space in which they are confined.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Ligament and Ligamentary Cartilage of the Hinge.</i></p>

  <p>These two distinct substances have been described by many writers as
  though, composing the same mass, they were of one substance; but the
  difference may very easily be explained. The <i>true ligament</i> is
  external, being fixed on the edge of one valve behind the umbones, and
  passing over in an arch to the corresponding edge of the other, very
  correctly retaining the name of <i>ligament</i>, because it serves the
  purpose of binding the two together. The thick, elastic substance, which
  Mr. Gray names the <i>cartilage</i>, is sometimes found in connexion with
  the ligament, so as to form one mass with it, although it is always
  separable and placed within it: it is sometimes placed quite within the
  shell, and separated from the ligament, in a pit or hollow formed for its
  reception in the hinge lamina, near the centre. It is found in both
  valves, and being elastic, the portion in one valve presses against that
  in the other, so as to keep the valves apart, unless voluntarily closed
  by the adductor muscles of the animal. The ligament is sometimes spread
  over an external area, as in Arca, while the cartilage is placed in
  several grooves of the same area, beneath the outer covering.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Hinge lamina, Teeth and Fulcrum of the Ligament.</i></p>

  <p>In a great variety of cases, there is a thickening of the substance of
  the shell within, under the dorsal margin; this is named the hinge
  lamina. It is sometimes merely callous; but in many cases it has raised
  <i>teeth</i> in both valves, those in one valve entering into
  corresponding cavities in the other. Those which are placed immediately
  below the umbones, and seem to take their rise from beneath them, are
  called <i>cardinal teeth</i>; those at a distance from the umbones, which
  are seen to lie along the upper margin of the shell are named <i>lateral
  teeth</i>.</p>

  <p>When the cardinal teeth terminate in a double point, which is not
  unfrequently the case, they are said to be <i>bifid</i>. The lateral
  teeth, in various species, are distinguished as terminating <i>near</i>
  to, or at a <i>distance</i> from the umbones. In the Nuculæ and Arcæ
  there is a row of teeth placed across the hinge lamina. In which case,
  the lateral cannot be distinguished from the cardinal teeth.</p>

    <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 74. <i>a, anterior; p, posterior; m
    i, muscular impressions.</i></p>
  </div>

  <p>Lamarck divides the Bivalve shells into two general orders; the first
  is named "Dimyaria," having two adductor muscles; and the second,
  "Monomyaria," having but one. These adductor muscles are used for the
  purpose of drawing the valves together, being composed of contractile
  fibrous gristle, fastened firmly to the inner surface of each valve. The
  place where they are thus fixed may be seen when the animal is removed,
  by depressed areas, which are generally pretty well defined, and are
  named <i>muscular impressions</i>. Where there is but one adductor
  muscle, there will be but one of these impressions near the centre of
  each valve, but in the Dimyaria, where there are two, the impressions are
  seen, one on the anterior, and one on the posterior of each valve, just
  below the <i>hinge</i> lamina. They are sometimes <i>complex</i>, that is
  composed of several portions in a group; but in general, they are simple
  and well defined.</p>

  <p>They are also described as large or small, in proportion to the size
  of the shell; regular or irregular in form. The animal is attached to the
  inner surface by the fibrous portions of the mantle, which creates a
  linear impression or <i>cicatrix</i>, commonly described as the
  <i>palleal impression</i>, or muscular impression of the mantle. It runs
  near the ventral margin from one muscular impression to the other,
  sometimes in a smooth <i>continuous</i> line or band, and sometimes in an
  interrupted series of small impressions. Near the point of union with the
  posterior muscular impression, there is sometimes a more or less
  considerable winding inwards towards the centre of the shell, and back
  again towards the point of union. This is named the <i>sinus</i>, and is
  distinguished as being <i>angular</i> or <i>rounded</i>, large or small,
  according to the species. When it enters towards the centre of the shell
  in a tongue-shaped outline it is said to be <i>ligulate</i>. Where it
  exists it affords a certain index to the posterior side of the shell; as
  it is the region through which the excretory tubes pass.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Umbones.</i></p>

  <p>These are the prominent points of the dorsal edge, where the growth of
  the shell commenced, and are called beaks, by some English writers. In
  some instances they are close to each other; in others they are rendered
  distant from each other by the intervention of areas in the hinge, as in
  Spondyli, &amp;c. In Pectunculus they are <i>straight</i>; in Venus
  <i>curved</i> towards the anterior margin; in Isocardia, <i>spiral</i>;
  in Chama, <i>decumbent</i>; in Diceras, <i>free</i>. In shells subject to
  external corrosion, the process commences at the umbones.</p>

  <p>When the <i>breadth</i> is spoken of, the distance between the most
  convex parts of both valves, when closed, is intended; but when an
  expression implying <i>thickness</i> is used, it refers to the substance
  of each valve: it is important to bear this in mind, as many persons have
  been misled by descriptions in which the distinction has not been
  attended to. Glycimeris (fig. 67 in the plates) is a <i>thick</i> shell,
  but Anatina (fig. 69 in the plates) is a <i>broad</i> one.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Regularity.</i></p>

  <p>A great number of Bivalves are extremely regular in their form. These
  are generally locomotive, and consequently free from those obstructions
  in growth occurring to stationary shells, which being confined in a
  particular position, or to a particular spot, modify their shape
  according to the substance with which they come in contact, and thus
  become irregular. This is generally the case with shells which are
  attached to submarine substances, such as Spondyli, Oysters, &amp;c.; and
  the degree of irregularity will depend upon the extent of surface
  involved in the attachment. In the case of fixed shells, the attached
  valve is usually termed the under valve, and the other which moves freely
  upon the hinge, is termed the upper valve.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><i>Form and Proportions.</i></p>

  <p>Bivalves are said to be <i>equivalve</i> when the two valves
  correspond in extent, breadth, and thickness; and of course
  <i>inequivalve</i> in the contrary case. They are <i>equilateral</i> when
  a line drawn from the umbones to the ventral margin would divide the
  shell into two nearly equal parts; and of course <i>inequilateral</i> in
  the opposite case, which occurs in the great majority of instances.</p>

  <p>A Bivalve is said to be <i>compressed</i>, when the distance is small
  from the most prominent part of one valve to that of the other. It is
  <i>cylindrical</i> when lengthened, and more or less rounded in its
  breadth, as in Lithodomus (fig. 161 in the plates). It is
  <i>cordiform</i> when the shape presents a resemblance to an imaginary
  heart, as in Cardium cardissa (fig. 122 in the plates), and in the
  Isocardia (fig. 126 in the plates). It is <i>linguiform</i> when it
  resembles a tongue in shape, as in Vulsella (fig. 185 in the plates);
  <i>rostrated</i> when it protrudes at either extremity, and terminates in
  a kind of point, as in Sanguinolaria Diphos (fig. 99 in the plates);
  <i>truncated</i> when it ends in a square or angle, as if cut off; an
  example of which may be seen in Solen (fig. 60 in the plates).</p>

  <p>Other Bivalves are distinguished as being <i>auriculated</i>, having
  processes flattened and expanded on either side of the umbones, as in
  Pecten (cut, fig. 82). When there is one of these on each side of the
  umbones, it is <i>bi-auriculated</i>; when only on one side, it is
  <i>uni-auriculated</i>. When the expansion is very broad, as in Unio
  alatus (fig. 142 in the plates), and in the Hammer Oyster (cut, fig. 83),
  the term <i>alated</i> is used.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:47%;">

    <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 82, <i>auriculated</i>; 83,
    <i>auriculated</i>, <i>alated</i>.</p>
  </div>

  <p>With regard to these alated species of <i>Uniones</i>, it is necessary
  to observe that they are also "<i>adnate</i>," as it is termed; the two
  valves being joined to each other by the dorsal edge of the expanded
  parts, and united so completely in substance with each other, that they
  cannot be separated without being broken. Many other terms are used to
  express difference in Bivalves, but being generally applicable to
  Univalves and Multivalves, as well as to them, they will be found
  explained at large in the alphabetical part of the work.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">MULTIVALVE SHELLS.</p>

  <p>These are of three different kinds; first, the "<i>dorsal</i>," as
  they are termed by Linnæus, because they form a ridge in the back of the
  animal. They are composed of eight pieces, or separate valves, placed in
  a longitudinal series, being joined to each other by inserted lamina, and
  named <i>Articulata</i> by De Blainville, on that account. The genus
  Chiton is the only example of this kind of Multivalves.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:48%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs84-85.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs84-85.png"
      alt="Figs. 84-85." title="Figs. 84-85." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 84, 85, Chiton. <i>a</i>, anterior;
    <i>p</i>, posterior; <i>d</i>, dorsal ridge; <i>l l</i>, lateral areas
    of the valves; <i>c c</i>, central areas; <i>i i</i>, inserted lamina;
    <i>m</i>, margin.</p>
  </div>

  <p>The second kind, M. De Blainville terms the <i>lateral</i> bivalves,
  the pieces being placed in pairs on each side of the animal; these
  compose the "Pedunculated Cirripedes."</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:32%;">
      <a href="images/cmfig86.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfig86.png"
      alt="Fig. 86." title="Fig. 86." /></a>
    <p style="text-align:center">Fig. 86, Anatina.</p>
  </div>

  <p>They differ considerably in the number and arrangement of the valves;
  the small ones, which are found near the peduncle in some species, are
  sometimes termed accessary valves; those which form the edge through
  which the bunch of Cilia protrude, are termed <i>ventral</i>, and those
  on the opposite side <i>dorsal</i>. The extremity joining the peduncle is
  the basal, or anterior; and the upper extremity is the apsiral, or
  posterior. The peduncle is the medium of attachment to submarine
  substances, to which this well known tribe of shells adhere.</p>

  <p>The third kind are termed <i>coronular</i> by De Blainville, and
  compose the order Sessile Cirripedes of Lamarck; they consist of a number
  of valves placed against each other side by side in a circle, supported
  on a plate, or tube, or cup, and closed by an operculum composed of two
  or more valves.</p>

  <p>The <i>basal support</i> is sometimes thick and flat, sometimes
  forming an elongated tube, and sometimes hollowed out into a cup. In
  other species it is altogether wanting. The operculum always consists of
  more than one piece, generally of two pairs: they are either articulated
  to each other by serrated edges, and placed against each other conically,
  as in Balanus, or they lie flat in two pairs against each other. Through
  the ventral pair the <i>cirrhi</i> protrude.</p>

  <p>The <i>parietal</i> valves, composing the principal part of the shell,
  vary in number, form and position. The <i>anterior</i> valves are placed
  on the same side with the cirrhi; the <i>posterior</i>, those on the
  opposite side; and those which remain between on each side are the
  lateral valves. In many cases, particularly in Balanus, each valve is
  separated into the <i>prominent</i> and <i>depressed</i> areas, and the
  inserted lamina. In some instances, the parietal portion is formed by a
  single rounded piece.</p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:44%;">
      <a href="images/cmfigs87-90.png"><img style="width:100%" src="images/cmfigs87-90.png"
      alt="Figs. 87-90." title="Figs. 87-90." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In the accompanying cut (87), the prominent areas are distinguished by
  the letters <i>pr</i>, and the depressed areas by <i>r</i>; the posterior
  valves of the operculum are marked <i>p. o.</i>, and the anterior <i>a.
  o.</i> The basal valve (fig. 88) belongs to a Balanus. Fig. 89 is an
  Acasta, the cup-shaped base of which is represented at fig. 90.</p>

  <p>In the foregoing explanations we have omitted many of those general
  terms which, relating to external characters, are applicable to shells in
  almost every division of the system. It may be as well, however, to
  enumerate a few of them in this place, although they are explained under
  their respective letters in the alphabetical part of the work.</p>

  <p>When bars or ribs, or large striæ are crossed by others radiating from
  the umbones, shells are said to be <i>cancellated</i>, as represented in
  cut, fig. 91. When there is a series of nodules or spines on the upper
  part of the whorls, they are <i>coronated</i>, as shewn in cut, fig. 92.
  When a series of projecting parts overlay each other, in the manner of
  tiles, as in the cut, fig. 93, the word <i>imbricated</i> is applied.
  When marked by a regular series of ridges, radiating from the apex, they
  are <i>pectinated</i>; the species of Chiton, a single valve of which is
  represented in cut, fig. 94, has received the specific name of
  <i>pectinatus</i>, in consequence of this character. Shells are said to
  be <i>plicated</i> when characterized by angular bendings or foldings in
  their surface, as shewn in cut, fig. 95. A strong instance of this is
  seen in the Ostræa Crista-Galli. When the margin of any shell has a
  series of minute notches, resembling the teeth of a saw, it is said to be
  <i>serrated</i>; when covered with raised points or spines it is
  <i>aculeated</i>; and when striated in both directions, it is
  <i>decussated</i>; when covered with a number of raised rounded points,
  it is <i>granulated</i>; and having a series of these points placed in a
  row, near or upon the edge, it is <i>denticulated</i>, as already
  explained in reference to the outer lips of Spiral Univalves. When the
  external surface is rendered uneven by raised knobs, it is said to be
  <i>tuberculated</i>; and if rendered rough and prickly by sharp points it
  is <i>muricated</i>, as in the cut, fig. 97. The term <i>reticulated</i>
  is applied to fine raised lines, crossing each other, and resembling fine
  net-work.</p>

  <p>By the foregoing general observations and explanations, it is trusted
  that the reader will be prepared for the following exposition of the
  general arrangement of Lamarck, and the principles upon which it is
  founded.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p class="ac lg125">GENERAL ARRANGEMENT</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">ACCORDING TO LAMARCK.</p>

  <p>In Lamarck's "Histoire Naturelle des Animaux sans Vertebres," he
  divides the invertebrata into classes, the 9th, 10th, and 11th of which
  include animals possessed of shells properly so called. These are the
  <span class="sc">Annelides</span>, the <span
  class="sc">Cirripedes</span>, the <span class="sc">Conchifera</span>, and
  the <span class="sc">Mollusca</span>.</p>

  <p>The class <span class="sc">Annelides</span> constitutes the 9th, and
  is divided into three orders, namely, the "Apodes," "Antennees," and
  "Sedentaires"; the last of which, <i>Sedentaria</i>, alone contains
  testaceous animals. This order includes tubular shells, which, with the
  exception of Dentalium, are irregularly twisted, and attached to each
  other, or to extraneous substances. The first family <i>Dorsalia</i>,
  contains the genus Siliquaria (plates, fig. 1), known from the Serpulæ,
  by the slit which passes through the whole length of the shell on the
  upper surface of the tube. The second family, <i>Maldania</i>, has the
  genus Dentalium (plates, fig. 2), a species of which are commonly known
  by the name of "tooth shells"; these are regularly formed, curved conical
  tubes, open at both extremities. The third family, <i>Serpulacea</i>,
  includes the genera Serpula, Spirorbis, Galeolaria, Vermilia,
  Spiroglyphus, and Magilus. The only shell that a learner would be likely
  to place among these incorrectly, according to the system, is the
  Vermetus (plates, fig. 345), which being regularly spiral at the apicial
  extremity, has been placed among the Mollusca; to which situation the
  whole of the shells under consideration have a better title than is
  generally supposed. It should be mentioned that the Serpulacea are
  provided with opercula.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Class <span class="sc">Cirripedes</span>.</p>

  <p>This class constitutes the tenth of invertebrated animals, and
  receives its name from the jointed and ciliated branchia which protrude
  between the opercular valves. They are Multivalve shells, and were all
  included in the single genus Lepas in the system of Linnæus, and are
  commonly known by the name "Barnacles." Lamarck has, however, divided
  them into two distinct orders. First, the <i>Sessile</i> Cirripedes or
  those which being composed of several valves, joined to each other, side
  by side in a circle, are attached to each other, or to submarine bodies
  by the basal portion of their own substance, and form a hollow, irregular
  cone, with the aperture above closed by an operculum consisting of two or
  more valves. Secondly, the <i>Pedunculated Cirripedes</i>, which are
  composed of valves placed in pairs against each other, so as to form a
  flattened disc attached by means of a tendinous tube called a peduncle.
  The first of these orders includes the genera Tubicinella, Coronula,
  Platylepas, Clitia, Conia, Elmineus, Catophragmus, Octomeris, Balanus,
  Creusia, Nobia, Savignium, Pyrgoma, Adna, Megatréma. The second contains
  the genera Pentelasmis, Scalpellum, Smilium, Pollicipes, Bisnæus,
  Lithotrya, Ibla, Octolasmis, Cineras, Otion.</p>

  <p>Conchological writers are not agreed as to the propriety of allowing
  the above to enter into the present science.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Class <span class="sc">Conchifera</span>.</p>

  <p>The shell of a conchiferous animal is always bivalve, composed of two
  pieces placed opposite to each other, joined at the dorsal margins by an
  elastic hinge. All true bivalve shells belong to animals of this class;
  and the correspondence between the shell and the animal is so true that
  on examining an empty bivalve shell we can not only determine that its
  inhabitant belonged to this class, but also decide on the particular
  order and family in which it should be placed, without seeing the soft
  parts.</p>

  <p>The first general division of Conchifera is that which results from
  observing the muscular impressions, or marks made on the inner surface of
  the valve by the insertion of the adductor muscles. All Conchifera are
  divided into two orders, as follows:</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">First Order, <i>Conchifera Dimyaria</i>.</p>

  <p>Having two adductor muscles, and consequently two impressions in each
  valve. They are separated into the following families:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n b1xtra">

  <p>1. <i>Tubicolæ</i> (plates, fig. 44 to 54), having shelly tubes
  besides the valves. This family contains the genera Aspergillum,
  Clavagella, Teredina, Teredo, Xylophaga, Fistulana, and Gastrochæna.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Pholadaria</i> (plates, fig. 55 to 59), cylindrical, living in
  holes in rocks pierced by the animals. Lamarck places in this family the
  genera Pholas and Gastrochæna, the last of which belongs more properly to
  the family Tubicolæ, as placed above.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Solenacea</i> (plates, fig. 60 to 68), longitudinally
  (transversely, Lam.) elongated, open at the anterior and posterior
  extremities. This family contains the genera Solen, Pholadomya, Panopæa,
  Glycimeris (Solecurtus) and Solenimya.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Myaria</i> (plates, fig. 69 to 76), ligament internal. A
  spoon-shaped ligamentary pit in one or both valves. Shell generally
  gaping at one or both extremities. This family includes the genera
  Anatina, Mya, Anatinella, Lyonsia, Myochama, Cleidotherus.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Mactracea</i> (plates, fig. 77 to 88), the cartilage placed in a
  trigonal pit, with a small external ligament. The genera Lutraria,
  Mactra, Crassatella, Erycina, Ungulina, Amphidesma, and Solenimya belong
  to this family, the last of which ought to have been placed among the
  Solenacea, as above.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Corbulacea</i> (plates, fig. 89, 90), inequivalve, with an
  internal ligament resembling the Mactracea, but differing in having one
  valve deeper than the other, although regular shells. This small family
  contains only the genera Corbula and Pandora.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Lithophagidæ</i> (plates, fig. 91 to 97), irregular,
  terebrating, living in holes of rocks. The genera are Saxicava,
  Petricola, and Venerirupis.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Nymphacea</i> (plates, fig. 98 to 110), ligament external,
  generally placed upon a prominent fulcrum, which passes from the inside
  to the outside of the hinge; valves generally gaping at the extremities.
  This family contains the genera Sanguinolaria, Psammobia, Psammotæa,
  Tellinides, Corbis, Lucina, Donax, Capsa, and Crassina.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Conchacea</i> (plates, fig. 111 to 121), regular, having several
  cardinal teeth and sometimes lateral teeth. The Conchacea constitute one
  of the most beautiful and numerous families of the class; they present
  equivalve shells, which are always regular, unattached, and in general
  closed, especially at the sides; they are always more or less
  inequilateral. They are divided into the <i>fluviatile</i> and <i>marine
  Conchacea</i>, the first containing the genera Cyclas, Cyrena, and
  Galathæa, found in rivers; and the second, Cyprina, Cytherea, Venus, and
  Venericardia.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Cardiacea</i> (plates, fig. 122 to 130). This family, which
  resembles the last in some general characters, are also regular and
  equivalve, and are generally provided with radiating ribs, which are
  seldom seen in the Conchacea. The genera enumerated in this family are
  Cardium, Cardita, Cypricardia, Hiatella, and Isocardia.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Arcacea</i> (plates, fig. 131 to 138). These are known by
  having a row of numerous small teeth on the cardinal hinge in each valve.
  The genera included are, Cucullæa, Arca, Pectunculus, Nucula.</p>

  <p>12. <i>Trigonacea</i> (plates, fig. 139 and 140). It is doubtful
  whether this family should remain distinct. As of the two genera placed
  in it, the first, Trigonia, is thought by some naturalists to have strong
  affinities with Nucula, in the family of Arcacea; and the latter,
  Castalia, certainly belongs to the Nayades.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Nayades</i> (plates, fig. 141 to 152). These are fresh-water
  shells, covered on the outside by a thick horny epidermis, and pearly
  within. They include the genera Unio, Hyria, Anodon, Iridina.</p>

  <p>14. <i>Chamacea</i> (plates, fig. 153 to 155), inequivalve, irregular,
  foliaceous, attached; containing the genera Diceras, Chama, and
  Etheria.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Second Order, <i>Conchifera Monomyaria</i>.</p>

  <p>Having one adductor muscle, and therefore only one impression in each
  valve. They are separated into the following families:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n b1xtra">

  <p>1. <i>Tridacnacea</i> (plates, fig. 156 &amp; 157), transverse,
  equivalve, with an elongated muscular impression, near the centre of the
  ventral margin; margin undulated at the termination of the radiated large
  ribs. The genera Tridacna and Hippopus are included.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Mytilacea</i> (plates, fig. 158 to 162), generally regular, with
  the hinge linear, without teeth, occupying the greater part of the dorsal
  margin. This family includes the genera Modiola, Mytilus, Pinna.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Malleacea</i> (plates, fig. 163 to 170), shell generally thin,
  inequivalve, irregular, foliaceous, with the hinge linear. This family
  contains the genera Crenatula, Perna, Malleus, Avicula, Meleagrina.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Pectinides</i> (plates, fig. 171 to 178). The Pectinides are
  generally regular or nearly so, with the shell solid; the greater part of
  them are auriculated at the dorsal margin, and generally characterized by
  ribs radiating from the umbones. The genera are Pedum, Lima, Plagiostoma,
  Pecten, Plicatula, Spondylus, Podopsis.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Ostracea</i> (plates, fig. 180 to 192). The shells of this
  family are irregular, generally attached and foliaceous. They compose the
  genera Gryphæa, Ostræa, Vulsella, Placuna, Anomia.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Rudistes</i> (plates 193 to 200). This family is composed of a
  particular association of shells, which appear on one side to be
  connected with the Ostracea; and on the other to approach the
  Brachiopoda. They differ from Ostracea in having no hinge or ligament,
  and only resemble them in their irregularity and foliaceous structure.
  The following six genera are placed by Lamarck in this
  family:&mdash;Sphærulites, Radiolites, Calceola, Birostrites, Discina,
  Crania. Of these, Calceola, Discina, and Crania are shewn to belong to
  the Brachiopoda.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Brachiopoda</i> (plates, fig. 201 to 219). The shells of this
  family are inequivalve, equilateral, and attached to marine bodies by a
  tendon passing through one of the valves. The animals have, near their
  mouth, two elongated, ciliated arms, which are spirally rolled when at
  rest. The following genera are enumerated by Lamarck, Orbicula,
  Terebratula, Lingula.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">MOLLUSCA.</p>

  <p>Lamarck applies, or rather restricts, this name to those invertebrated
  animals, which while they are inarticulate in all their parts, have the
  head sufficiently advanced at the anterior part of the body to be
  distinguished; which is not the case with the Conchifera. All the shells
  are univalve, and are divided into six orders, namely, the <span
  class="sc">Pteropoda</span>, which have wing-shaped natatory organs or
  fins, and have <i>light</i>, <i>thin transparent</i>, <i>nearly
  symmetrical</i> shells; the <span class="sc">Gasteropoda</span>, with the
  foot not distinguishable from the rest of the body, have
  <i>patelliform</i>, <i>open</i>, and <i>scarcely spiral</i> shells; the
  <span class="sc">Trachelipoda</span> with the foot distinct and attached
  to the neck of the animal, have <i>spiral</i>, <i>non-symmetrical</i>
  shells. The <span class="sc">Cephalopoda</span>, with arms covered by
  suckers surrounding the head of the animal, have generally <i>symmetrical
  convolute</i> shells. The Cephalopoda are divided into <i>C.
  polythalamia</i>, which have the internal cavity divided into chambers by
  septa, as in the Nautilus; and the <i>C. Monothalamia</i>, which are not
  so divided, as the Argonauta. The order <i>Heteropoda</i> contains the
  genus Carinaria alone.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Pteropoda</i>.</p>

  <p>This order, containing hyaline, symmetrical, non-spiral shells, as
  above described, is not divided into families, but contains the following
  genera, Hyalæa, Cleodora, Limacina, Cymbulia; the first of which,
  although composed of a single piece, resembles a bivalve so nearly, that
  Linnæus actually placed it in his genus Anomia.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Gasteropoda</i>.</p>

  <p>With the exception of the genus Bulla and Vitrina, the last of which
  forms a passage into the next order, the shells contained in this order
  are <i>patelliform</i>, <i>open</i>, <i>and scarcely spiral</i>. They are
  divided into the following families:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n b1xtra">

  <p>1. <i>Phyllidiana</i> (plates, fig. 227 to 231), containing the genera
  Chiton, Chitonellus, and Patella, the two former of which present the
  only exception to the statement above made, that all the shells of
  Mollusca were univalve.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Semiphyllidiana</i> (plates, fig. 232 and 233). Of the two
  genera contained in this family, Pleurobranchus is broad, thin, and
  slightly spiral at the apex, and Umbrella is flat, circular, with a
  central apex.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Calyptracea</i> (plates, fig. 234 to 246). The patelliform
  shells of this family, although united by no other general characters,
  are brought together by the characters of the animals which produce them.
  The genera are Parmophorus, Emarginula, Siphonaria, Fissurella,
  Pileopsis, Calyptræa, Crepidula, Ancylus.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Bulleana</i> (plates, fig. 247 to 253), contains the genera
  Bulla and Bullæa.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Aplysiacea</i> (plates, fig. 254 and 255). The genera Aplysia
  and Dolabella are both expanded, somewhat flattened shells, with the apex
  placed at one extremity, and slightly spiral.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Limacinea</i> (fig. 256 to 263). Many of the animals (slugs) are
  without shells; some, as the Limax, or common garden slug, have a
  slightly developed calcareous piece, hidden beneath the mantle, and of
  others the shells are scarcely spiral. The genera included in this family
  are, Parmacella, Limax, Testacella, Vitrina.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Trachelipoda</i>.</p>

  <p>All the remaining spiral non-symmetrical shells are arranged in this
  order, which is divided into the following families:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n b1xtra">

  <p>1. <i>Colimacea</i> (plates, fig. 264 to 307). With the exception of
  the few contained in the family of Limacina, which ought not to be
  separated from this order, the whole of the land-shells are contained in
  this family, and although it is difficult to notice any one character by
  which terrestrial shells may be distinguished from others, few at all
  conversant with the subject are liable to mistake them. There is a
  general lightness and simplicity of form, which, though not clearly
  definable, is generally understood. The following distribution of genera
  by Lamarck, is generally acknowledged to require numerous modifications;
  the genera are Helix, Carocolla, Anostoma, Helicina, Pupa, Clausilia,
  Bulinus, Achatina, Succinea, Auricula, Cyclostoma.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Lymneana</i> (plates, fig. 308 to 312). The shells of this
  family are found in fresh water, wells, ditches, and ponds. They are of a
  light horny structure, and simple form. The genera Planorbis, Physa, and
  Lymnea are placed in this family by Lamarck.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Melaniana</i> (plates, fig. 313 to 317). These are also found in
  fresh water, principally in rivers; they are thicker than those of the
  last family; and the greater part of them have elevated spires composed
  of numerous whorls. This family contains the genera Melania, Melanopsis,
  Pirena.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Peristomata</i> (plates, fig. 318 to 322). These are also
  fresh-water shells, having opercula, and covered by a smooth green, or
  greenish-brown epidermis. They differ from the last family in having the
  peritreme entire. The genera are Valvata, Paludina, and Ampullaria.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Neritacea</i> (plates, fig. 323 to 333). The peculiarity of the
  shells of this family consists in the inner lip being flattened and
  rather straight at the inner edge. The genera are Navicella, Neritina,
  Nerita, Natica, and Janthina, the last of which forms an exception to the
  general character, and is placed by De Blainville in a family by
  itself.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Macrostomata</i> (plates, fig. 334 to 341), so named, on account
  of the large open aperture which they present in comparison to the spire.
  The shells of this family, which contains the genera Stomatia,
  Stomatella, and Haliotis, are pearly within.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Plicacea</i> (plates, fig. 342 to 344), contains the genera
  Tornatella and Pyramidella.</p>

  <p>8. <i>Scalariana</i> (plates, fig. 345 to 352). The genera Vermetus,
  Scalaria and Delphinula, seem to have been placed in this family by
  Lamarck, on account of the whorls being distinct from each other.</p>

  <p>9. <i>Turbinacea</i> (plates, 353 to 371). The shells contained in
  this family are all more or less globose, or angular, thickened and
  pearly within. The following genera are included in this division by
  Lamarck, Solarium, Rotella, Trochus, Monodonta, Turbo, Planaxis,
  Phasianella, and Turritella.</p>

  <p>10. <i>Canalifera</i> (plates, fig. 372 to 401). The numerous genera
  of which this family is formed, namely, Cerithium, Pleurotoma,
  Turbinella, Cancellaria, Fasciolaria, Fusus, Pyrula, Ranella, Murex,
  Triton, are distinguished by having at the anterior termination of the
  aperture, a more or less elongated canal.</p>

  <p>11. <i>Alatæ</i> (plates, fig. 402 to 406). These are known by having
  the outer lip more or less expanded and generally a posterior canal
  leaning towards the spire. The genera are Rostellaria, Strombus, and
  Pteroceras.</p>

  <p>12. <i>Purpurifera</i> (plates, fig. 407 to 429). In these, the canal,
  if such it may be called, is extremely short, and turning abruptly
  backwards, produces a kind of varix at the lower part of the whorl. The
  genera enumerated in this family are Cassidaria, Cassis, Ricinula,
  Purpura, Monoceras, Concholepas, Harpa, Dolium, Buccinum, Eburna,
  Terebra.</p>

  <p>13. <i>Columellata</i> (plates, fig. 430 to 433). The shells of this
  family are emarginated at the anterior extremity of the aperture, and the
  inner lip is characterized by plates or folds, which, with the exception
  of those on Columbella, are distinct. The genera are Mitra, Voluta,
  Marginella, Volvaria, Columbella, the latter of which would be better
  placed among the Purpurifera.</p>

  <p>14. Convolutæ (plates, fig. 444 to 462). The well-known shells
  contained in this family are distinguished for the small proportion of
  the spire, if any, which remains uncovered by the last whorl. They might
  be well divided into two groups, the first containing the genera Ovulum
  and Cypræa, under the name of Cypræadæ, which are truly convolute, having
  the spire entirely hidden; and the second containing the genera Oliva.
  Ancillaria, and Conus.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Polythalamous, or Chambered Cephalopoda.</i></p>

  <p>The greater part of the shells belonging to this order are
  symmetrical, and the internal cavity is divided into separate
  compartments, by plates called <i>Septa</i>. It is divided into the
  following families:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n b1xtra">

  <p>1. <i>Orthocerata</i> (plates, fig. 463 to 470), containing the genera
  Belemnites, Orthoceras, Nodosaria, Hippurites, and Conilites. Hippurites
  certainly has no affinity with the Cephalopoda, but is ascertained to be
  a bivalve shell, properly belonging to the family Rudistes; the other
  genera are straight, elongated, and conical.</p>

  <p>2. <i>Lituacea</i> (plates, fig. 471), containing the genera Spirula,
  Spirulina, and Lituola, the two latter of which are microscopic.</p>

  <p>3. <i>Cristacea</i>, containing the microscopic genera Renulina,
  Orbiculina, and Cristellaria.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Spherulacea</i>, containing the microscopic genera Miliola,
  Gyrogona, and Melonia.</p>

  <p>5. <i>Radiolacea</i>, containing the microscopic genera Rotalites,
  Lenticulina, Placentula.</p>

  <p>6. <i>Nautilacea</i> (plates, fig. 472 to 476). This family contains
  the following genera&mdash;Discorbites, Siderolites, Polystomella,
  Vorticialis, Nummulites, and Nautilus; the two latter of which alone are
  now received in cabinets of shells, the four former belonging to that
  class of microscopic fossils, now termed Foraminifera; the genus
  Nummulites, although large, may probably belong to the same class, and
  perhaps it would have been better to have included the remaining genus,
  Nautilus, in the next family, from which it differs in having the septa
  which divides the chambers simple at their edges.</p>

  <p>7. <i>Ammonacea</i> (plates, fig. 477 to 484). The edges of the septa
  of these are all more or less sinuous and complicated. This family
  contains the following genera, Ammonites, Ammonoceras, Baculites, and
  Turrilites, the latter of which presents a singular anomaly in having an
  oblique spire, like that of the order Trachelipoda, while it is divided
  into chambers by sinuous septa.</p>

</blockquote>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Monothalamous Cephalopoda</i>.</p>

  <p>The only shells included in this order belong to the genera Argonauta
  (plates, fig. 485), placed here by Lamarck, and Bellerophon (plates, fig.
  486 and 487), a fossil genus subsequently added.</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;">Order <i>Heteropoda</i>.</p>

  <p>The singular and beautiful transparent shell contained in this order,
  under the generic name Carinaria, forms a covering to a small portion of
  an animal, equally remarkable and equally distinct from those of all
  other orders.</p>

  <p>&nbsp;</p>

  <p>The above arrangement, although far from perfect, and requiring
  numerous modifications, is perhaps liable to as few objections as any
  other yet proposed, and will certainly be more easily understood by those
  who have not the opportunity of studying the soft parts of the
  animal.</p>

  accidental circumstance, resulting from the situations in which the
  shells acquire their growth. If, for instance, the Balanus be attached to
  a flat surface, in an open situation, the base will be short and flat; if
  it be placed in a hollow among other growing substances, it will be
  lengthened out in order that the aperture of the shell may be even with
  the outer surface of the surrounding mass; and if, as in the Acastæ, it
  be imbedded in a soft and loose substance, the base, being left to

  <p>ADESMACEA. Bl. (<i>a</i>, without; <span title="Desma" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&epsilon;&sigma;&mu;&alpha;</span>, <i>desma</i>, ligament.) The
  10th family of the order <i>Lamellibranchiata</i>, Bl. composed of
  Mollusca which either bore tubular dwellings in rocks, wood, &amp;c. or
  live in testaceous tubes, their shells being consequently destitute of
  the hinge ligament. The action of opening and shutting the valves being
  limited to the narrow space to which they are confined, or else the
  valves themselves being soldered into the tube, renders it unnecessary
  for them to have a ligament to keep them in their places. The genera
  Pholas, Teredina, Fistulana, and Septaria, belong to this family, which
  corresponds in part with the families Tubicolaria and Pholadaria, of
  Lamarck.</p>

  <p>ADNA. Leach. One of the genera separated by Leach from <i>Pyrgoma</i>,
  and characterized as consisting of an upper valve, supported on a
  funnel-shaped base, which is not buried in the coral to which it is
  attached, like Pyrgoma, but is seen externally. The operculum consists of
  four valves. Adna, fig. 32. British Channel and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>ADNATE. A term applied by some authors to those shells belonging to
  the family of Unionidæ, which have the valves joined together at the
  dorsal margin, not like other bivalves, by a distinct ligament, but by
  the substance of the shell itself, the valves appearing to grow together
  in such a manner that they cannot be separated without one of them being
  broken as will be seen in our figure of Dipsas plicatus, fig. 142. This
  circumstance has been made the foundation of specific and even generic
  distinctions, for which however it is insufficient, because many species
  which when young are "<i>adnate</i>," when fully grown have their valves
  joined together only by a ligament.</p>

  from the Nautilacea. This family contains the genera Discorbites,
  Scaphites, Ammonites, and Simplegas.</p>

  <p>AMMONACEA. Lam. The seventh family of Polythalamous Cephalopoda, Lam.

  <p>AMMONITES. Auct. (from Jupiter Ammon.) <i>Fam.</i> Ammonacea, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Symmetrical, convolute, discoidal, orbicular;
  chambers numerous, divided by lobated, branched or sinuous septa,
  perforated by a Siphon; aperture generally more or less modified by the
  last whorl. The fossils of the secondary strata which compose this genus
  are numerous and well known; they are vulgarly termed "snake-stones," and
  some of them are extremely beautiful, particularly when the internal
  structure is exhibited by a section. There is some difficulty in
  distinguishing them from the Fossil Nautili, for although the whorls,
  being visible and the Septa <i>sinuous</i>, may be taken as the
  characteristics of the Ammonites, yet there are several species which
  partake the characters of both. The Orbulites of Lamarck (fig. 479) for
  instance, have sinuous septa like Ammonites, but the last whorl covers
  those which precede it as in Nautilus. Simplegas Montf. and Bl. (fig.

  Equivalve, oval or rounded, sub-equilateral, sometimes rather gaping at
  the sides, with slight posterior fold; hinge with one or two cardinal
  teeth in each valve, and two elongated lateral teeth, distinct in one
  valve, nearly obsolete in the other; ligament short, separated from the
  cartilage, which is elongated and couched obliquely in an excavation of
  the hinge.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> In most bivalve shells, the cartilage and
  ligament are united in one mass, or placed close to each other; the
  contrary in this case gives rise to the name, which signifies <i>double
  ligament</i>. This circumstance distinguishes the genus Amphidesma from
  Tellina, which in other respects it greatly resembles. From Lutraria it
  may be known by its distinct lateral teeth, and also by its valves being
  nearly close all round, while the Lutrariæ gape anteriorly. The species
  do not appear to be numerous, no fossil species are known. A.

  globular, sometimes discoidal, frequently umbilicated, covered with a
  rounded, horny epidermis; spire short; whorls rapidly enlarging; aperture
  elliptical, rounded anteriorly; peristome nearly or quite entire,
  thickened and slightly reflected; operculum, testaceous, annular, with a
  subcentral nucleus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of fresh-water shells of
  which a few fossil species occur, is easily distinguished from other
  genera, by obvious characters, particularly by a thick, horny,
  greenish-brown epidermis, and the rotundity in form. One species, the A.
  Cornu-arietis which forms the type of Lamarck's genus Planorbis, requires
  notice on account of its flatness, but may be known by the aperture which
  in the Ampullaria is longer than wide, and in Planorbis the contrary.
  Lanistes, Montf. is described from a <i>reversed</i> species of
  Ampullaria. The Ampullaria is vulgarly called the Idol Shell, and is said

  cavity. It is supposed that the animal has the power of filling this bag
  with water, and that it is thus enabled to live a long time out of water.

  <p>ANASTOMA or ANOSTOMA. Fischer. (from <span title="Ana" class="grk"
  >&Alpha;&nu;&alpha;</span>, <i>ana</i>, backwards; <span title="Stoma" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span>, <i>stoma</i>, mouth)
  <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lamark. A genus of land shells so named from the
  singular circumstance of the last whorl taking a sudden turn and
  reflecting the aperture upwards, so as to present it on the same plane
  with the spire; so that the animal walks with the spire of the shell
  downwards resting on the foot. In other respects, the two species of
  which this genus is composed, resemble other Helices; and belong to De
  Ferrusac's division "Helicodonta." <i>Tomogerus</i> is De Montfort's name
  for this genus. <i>A. depressum</i> is represented in the plates figs.
  271, 272. The nearest approach to this genus will be found in the fossil
  shell named Strophostoma, by Deshayes, which, however, has no teeth in
  the aperture and is provided with an operculum like Cyclostoma. South
  America.</p>

  <p>ANATIFER. Brug. <span class="sc">Anatifa</span>, Lam. This name, which
  signifies Duckbearing, has been given to the shells commonly called
  Barnacles, on account of an absurd notion entertained among the ancients,
  that they inclose the young of the Barnacle duck, in an embryo state. The
  beautiful bunch of jointed arms, the ciliæ of which serve the purpose of
  agitating the water, so as to draw in food by the current, were supposed
  to be the feathers of the future bird. For a description of these shells,
  see <span class="sc">Pentelasmis</span>; and fig. 34.</p>

  <p>ANATINA. Lam. (<i>That which belongs to a duck.</i>) <i>Fam.</i>
  Myaria, Lam. Pyloridea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, transparent,
  generally equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, marine; hinge with a
  spoon-shaped process in each valve, containing the
  cartilage.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Some species included in the genus Anatina
  of authors, A. striata, for instance, have not the spoon-shaped
  prominence, but in its place a small, testaceous, moving appendage,
  connected with the interior of the hinge. These are now separated, and
  form the genus <span class="sc">Lyonsia</span>. The genus Næara, Gray, is
  composed of Anatina longirostrum, and similar species, which have neither
  the bony appendage nor the spoon-shaped prominence. Mya is distinguished
  from Anatina, by the thickness of the shell, and also by having the
  prominence only in the hinge of one valve. Fig. 69. A. rostrata. The
  Anatinæ are found in the East Indies and South Sea Islands.</p>

  <p>ANATINELLA. G. B. Sowerby. (Dimunition of <i>Anatina</i>). A genus so
  named from its resemblance to Anatina, from which it differs in being
  destitute of the internal appendage, and having no sinus in the palleal
  impression. One species having been brought from Ceylon, received the
  name of Anatinella Sibbaldii. Another has lately been found in the
  Philippine Islands. Fig. 70.</p>

  <p>ANATOMUS. Montf. Tom. 2, plate 279. A microscopic shell, appearing
  from the figure to resemble <span class="sc">Scissurella</span>.</p>

  <p>ANAULAX. Brogn. <span class="sc">Ancillaria</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>ANCILLA. Lam. <span class="sc">Ancillaria</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>ANCILLARIA. Auct. <span class="sc">Ancilla</span>, Lam. (<i>A
  handmaid.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> convolutæ, Lam. Angyostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Smooth, oblong, subcylindrical. Spire short,
  sutures hidden by enamel. Aperture long, anteriorly emarginated and
  somewhat effuse. Columella tortuous, oblique, tumid,
  truncated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Ancillariæ are pretty shining shells,
  enveloped almost entirely by the soft parts of the animal. They resemble
  Oliva, from which they are distinguished by the suture of the spire being
  filled up with shelly enamel, nearly covering the surface. The whorls in
  Oliva being separated by a distinct canal. Ancillaria may be known from
  Terebellum by the tumid varix at the base of the columella. The well
  known Ivory shell, Eburna glabrata, <i>Lam.</i> belongs to this genus, of
  which a few fossil species are found in the London clay, Calcaire
  grossièr and green sand, Turin. The recent species are found in the
  Islands of the Indian Ocean and Australian Seas. A. glabrata is
  represented in the plates fig. 455; A. cinnamonea, fig. 456.</p>

  <p>ANCULOSA. Say. <i>Fam.</i> Melaniana, Lam. Ellipsostomata, Bl. A genus
  proposed to include some fresh-water shells resembling those of the genus
  Melania, the difference between them being that the spire of Anculosa is
  more depressed, and the anterior of the outer lip more angulated than in
  Melania. On an examination of the different species, however, it will be
  found that this is quite unsatisfactory, as a generic distinction;
  because some of the species with short flattened spires, have rounded,
  and others angulated apertures. North America. An example of each is
  represented, fig. 314.</p>

  <p>ANCYLUS. Geoffroy. <i>Fam.</i> Calyptracea, Lam. Otides,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, obliquely conical, patelliform; apex acute,
  turned sidewise and backwards; aperture oval; margin
  simple.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Although the little fresh-water shells
  described under this name, resemble those of the genus Patella, the
  animals which produce them are nearly allied to the Lymneanæ. And, it may
  also be observed, that the shells themselves differ from Patella in not
  being quite symmetrical, having the apex turned on one side. A.
  fluviatilis, fig. 246. Found in Great Britain, and in Southern and
  Central Europe, West Indies, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>ANDROMEDES. Montf. <span class="sc">Vorticialis</span>, Lam.
  <i>Fam.</i> Nautilacea, Lam. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>ANGULATED. (Angulatus.) Having an angle, or corner, as the anterior of
  the aperture of Eulima, fig. 348; the posterior side of Castalia, fig.
  140; the whorls of Carocolla, fig. 277.</p>

  <p>ANGULITES. Montf. A genus composed of species of fossil <span
  class="sc">Nautili</span>, described by De Blainville as not umbilicated,
  with a dorsal keel and angular aperture. <span class="sc">Nautilus</span>
  triangularis Buffon.</p>

  <p>ANGIOSTOMATA. Bl. The third family of Siphonobranchiata, Bl. described
  as differing little from the family of Entomostomata, but having long,
  narrow, straight apertures, and the columellar lips straight or nearly
  so. Were it not for the admission of the genus Strombus into this family,
  it would correspond with <span class="sc">Columellaria</span> and <span
  class="sc">Convolutæ</span> of Lamarck.</p>

  <p>ANNELIDES. The ninth class of invertebrated animals, divided into
  three orders, namely, A. Apodes, A. Antennés, and A. Sedentaires. The
  last only contains families of testaceous Mollusca. The animals are
  vermicular, some naked, others inhabiting shelly tubes. See <span
  class="sc">Sedentary Annelides</span>.</p>

  <p>ANNULAR OPERCULUM is one which has the nucleus central, or nearly so,
  the other layers surrounding it in flattened rings. The term concentric
  is also applied. See Introduction.</p>

  <p>ANNULATED. (Annus, a ring.) Composed of, or surrounded by rings, as in
  the case of Tubicinella, fig. 14.</p>

  <p>ANODON. Brug. <i>Fam.</i> Submytilacea, Bl. Nayades, Lam. A genus
  composed of such species of <span class="sc">Nayades</span> as are
  destitute of teeth on the hinge. Europe, North America, &amp;c. An
  example is given in A. Cataractus, fig. 152.</p>

  <p>ANOMALINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>ANOMIA. <i>Fam.</i> Ostracea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Irregular, inequivalve, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'sub-equilaternal'."
  >sub-equilateral</span>, foliaceous, pearly within; adhering to marine
  substances by means of a bony appendage, which passes through a large
  circular opening in the lower valve; muscular impression divided into
  three irregular portions; hinge destitute of teeth with a short
  cartilage.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Linnæan genus included not only the
  shells to which the description above given would apply, but also many
  other genera, such as Crania, Orbicula, Terebratula, &amp;c. which belong
  to the Brachiopoda, and are perfectly distinct. The Anomiæ are found in
  Europe, N. America, Moluccas, Philippine Islands, &amp;c. Fig. 186, in
  the plates, is a somewhat reduced representation of a full grown specimen
  of A. Ephippium. Fig. 187, the hinge of the under valve, with the bony
  process. Fig. 188, the hinge showing the opening through which it
  passes.</p>

  <p>ANOSTOMA. See <span class="sc">Anastoma</span>.</p>

  <p>ANSATES. Klein. A genus formed of those species of Patella which have
  a produced, recurved beak. Helcion, Montf. <i>Ex.</i> Patella pellucida,
  fig. 230.</p>

  <p>ANSULUS or ANSYLUS. Mr. Gray conjectures that the name of the genus
  Ancylus, should be so written.</p>

  <p>ANTENOR. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>ANTERIOR. In Bivalves is the side on which the head, or part analogous
  to the head of the animal lies; it is known in the shell by the umbones,
  which if turned at all, are turned towards that part. If there be a sinus
  in the impression of the mantle, it is always on the posterior part of
  the shell. If the ligament be placed only on one side of the umbones, it
  is only on the posterior side. The anterior of a <i>spiral univalve</i>
  is that part of the outer lip which is at the greatest distance from the
  apex. Of a <i>symmetrical</i> conical univalve such as Patella, it is
  that part where the head of the animal lies, indicated by the
  interruption of the muscular impression. Of <i>cirripedes</i>, that part
  where the ciliæ protrude are anterior; of <i>Brachiopoda</i>, that part
  which is farthest from the umbones and which corresponds with the ventral
  margin in other Bivalves. The anterior of <i>symmetrical, convolute
  univalves</i>, is the outer or dorsal part of the aperture, or that part
  which is farthest from the spire. Lamarck and other Conchological writers
  have occasioned much confusion by their errors on this subject;
  describing the same part of a shell at one time anterior, at another
  posterior; but generally the reverse of the above arrangement, which is
  founded upon the natural position of the animal, and generally adopted.
  The anterior will be indicated by the letter <i>a</i>, in figs. 119, 421,
  229, 34, 202.</p>

  <p>ANTIGONA. Schum. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Venus</span>
  cancellata, Lam. (fig. 119.) and similar species.</p>

  <p>ANTIQUATED. This word, signifying <i>out of date</i>, is occasionally
  used to express that species of composition which constantly occurs in
  shells, by each fresh deposit or layer of calcareous matter, forming a
  new margin, which being replaced by its successor, is no longer used as
  the margin, and is consequently said to be out of date.</p>

  <p>APEX. This term does not apply to the natural position of a shell, but
  is used in a mathematical sense, to indicate the nucleus or first formed
  part; which may be considered as the point of the spiral cone. From this
  point, the shell enlarging rapidly or slowly as it descends, takes a
  spiral, arched, straight, oblique, convolute, or irregularly spiral
  course. The apex will be indicated by the letter <i>a</i>, in fig. 282
  and 466.</p>

  <p>APERTURE or MOUTH. The entrance to the spiral cavity of univalve
  shells. The parts of the aperture are separately described, as follows:
  The inner lip or labium is that part which lies over the preceding whorl
  of the shell. It terminates anteriorly, or towards the lower part in what
  is termed the columella, so called because it forms a kind of axis on
  which the volutions turn. The outer lip, sometimes called the labrum, is
  on the opposite side, or the farthest from the axis. If the edges of the
  inner and outer lips unite all round, they are described as composing the
  peritrême. In fig. 318, the aperture is marked by the letter
  <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>APHRODITA. Lea. (from <span title="Aphroditê" class="grk"
  >&Alpha;&phi;&rho;&omicron;&delta;&iota;&tau;&eta;</span>, Greek name of
  Venus.) A genus composed of <span class="sc">Cardium</span>
  Groenlandicum, Auct. fig. 123*, and other similar species of Cardium, the
  teeth of which are either wholly wanting, or very indistinct. Northern
  Ocean.</p>

  <p>APICIAL. Belonging to the apex. The apicial extremity of the aperture
  of a univalve shell, is that which is nearest to the apex of the
  spire.</p>

  <p>APICULUM. Humph. <span class="sc">Trochus</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>APLEUROTIS. Rafinesque. A genus unfigured and imperfectly described as
  differing in some respects from Terebratula and other Brachiopodæ.</p>

  <p>APLEXUS. Fleming. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Physa</span>
  Hypnorum, Drap. &amp;c. and described as having the inner lip simple, and
  not spread over the body whorl.</p>

  <p>APLODON. Rafinesque. A genus proposed to be established at the expense
  of the genus <span class="sc">Helix</span>, but upon what grounds does
  not appear from the imperfect description which is unaccompanied by a
  figure.</p>

  <p>APLUSTRE. Schum. A genus formed for the reception of those species of
  <span class="sc">Bulla</span> which have the spire uncovered. <i>Ex.</i>
  Bulla Aplustre, (<i>aplustre</i>, a flag.) Auct. fig. 289.</p>

  <p>APLYSIA. Linn. (<i>a</i>, without; <span title="Pluô" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&upsilon;&omega;</span>, to wash.) <i>Fam.</i> Laplysiens,
  Lam. Aplysiana, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Horny, transparent, clypeiform,
  or shield-shaped, placed horizontally on the back of the animal, with its
  convex side uppermost; apex slightly incurved.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  animal producing this shell has derived its name from the purplish liquor
  which it exudes, when disturbed. In contour, it has been fancied to
  present a certain likeness to a hare crouching, and on this account was
  called <i>Lepus marinus</i>, or sea hare, by the ancients. The shell
  bears a strong resemblance to Dolabella, which, however, is much thicker,
  and more testaceous. The species are found in the Mediterranean,
  European, and West Indian Seas. A. Petersoni, fig. 254.</p>

  <p>APLYSIACEA. Bl. The second family of the order Monopleurobranchiata,
  Bl. The animals composing this family are either destitute of shells, or
  are provided with internal ones, which are flat, open, oblique, with the
  apex or nucleus slightly incurved, not distinctly spiral. This family
  contains the genera, Aplysia and Dolabella. The first sub-spiral, with
  the apex terminal; shell thin, horny. Fig. 254. The second the same, but
  thick and shelly. Fig. 255.</p>

  <p>APOLLON. Montf. <span class="sc">Ranella</span> Ranina, Auct. Placed
  by De Blainville in that division of Ranella, which is characterized as
  being umbilicated. Fig. 393.</p>

  <p>APOROBRANCHIATA. Bl. The first order of the second section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica, Bl. The Thecosmata is the only family of this
  order containing any approach to shells, these are Hyalæa and
  Cymbulia.</p>

  <p>APORRHAIS. Petiver. A genus formed of <span
  class="sc">Rostellaria</span> Pes-pelicani, <i>Auct.</i> (fig. 404) and
  similar species. Although the shell presents no characters to distinguish
  it generically from Rostellaria, those who have examined the soft parts
  are convinced that it is distinct. Of the three species now known and
  figured in part I. of Thesaurus Conchyliorum, by the Author, one is
  common on our own coast, and in the Mediterranean; also North America.
  See <span class="sc">Rostellaria</span>.</p>

  <p>AQUATIC. A term applied by some authors to those species of Molluscous
  animals, which inhabit fresh water, either in rivers, or salt water
  standing pools, as distinguished from the marine or Mollusca. See
  Fresh-water.</p>

  <p>AQUILLUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Triton</span> Lampas, Cutaceus,
  &amp;c. Auct. Placed by De Blainville in the division of the genus
  Triton, which is described as having a short spire, being covered with
  tubercles and umbilicated. Triton Cutaceus, fig. 399.</p>

  <p>ARCA. Auct. (Anglicè, a boat.) <i>Fam.</i> Arcacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Obliquely transverse, subquadrate, equivalve, or
  nearly so, inequilateral, thick, ventricose, longitudinally ribbed,
  dentated near the inner margins; hinge rectilinear, forming a flat,
  external area, upon which the ligament is spread in cross rows, and
  having a series of small, regular teeth, extending on both sides of the
  umbones in each valve; muscular impressions distant.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  The shells composing this genus are easily distinguished from those of
  all other bivalve shells, by the straight, linear row of small, notched
  teeth, and by the area between the umbones. The genus <i>Cucullæa</i>
  makes the nearest approach to it in this respect, but it may easily be
  known from it by the outermost teeth on each side of the row being
  oblique, and lengthened out; and also by the prominent edge of the
  muscular impression. These shells are found recent, in various marine
  localities; fossil, in the tertiary deposits. The Arca Noæ, formerly
  regarded as the type of this genus, has, with several other species, been
  separated from it under the name of Bysso-arca, by Swainson, on account
  of an hiatus in the ventral margin, to admit the passage of a byssus;
  this is not found in the true Arcæ. The true Arcæ are mostly tropical.
  Arca Antiquata, fig. 131. Bysso-arca Noæ, 132.</p>

  <p>ARCACEA. Lam. A family of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, characterized
  by a series of teeth placed on the hinge in a line. The genera may be
  distinguished as follows,</p>

  a poetical illusion further heightened by the broad, flat membranes of
  the two arms, which, when vertically expanded, present an idea of sails.

  <p>ARROW-HEADS. One of the names by which fossils of the genus Belemnites
  were formerly known.</p>

  <p>ARTEMIS. A genus of bivalve shells, distinguished from those of the
  genus Venus, by having a rounded, denticular form, and a deep, angular
  sinus in the palleal impression. This does not appear to me to be a
  sufficient ground of generic distinction, the palleal impressions of the
  Veneres being subject to great variations. British, also from West

  <p>ARTICULATED. (Jointed.) Applied to distinct parts of shells, which are
  fitted or jointed into each other, as the valves of Chitones and those of
  Balani. The operculum of Nerita is said to be <i>articulated</i> to the
  columella, having a small process by which it is as it were locked under

  <p>ASPERGILLUM. Lam. (From <i>Aspergo</i>, to sprinkle.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Tubicolæ, Lam. Pyloridea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> The small, equal,
  equilateral valves are cemented into, so as to form part of, a large
  tube; the umbones are slightly prominent outside. The tube is elongated,
  rather irregular, granulated with sandy particles, and terminated at the
  base by a convex disc, which is perforated by small pores, elongated into
  tubes round the edge, presenting a resemblance to the spout of a watering
  pot, whence the name is derived. <i>Loc.</i> New Holland, Java, New

  rounded beneath; aperture elliptical, slightly modified by the last
  whorl; inner lip planed; outer lip thin; operculum horny, subspiral.
  Found in brackish water; one species may be procured abundantly on the
  muddy shores of the Thames, in Kent. There are also species from
  Calcutta, China, Tahiti, and Australia. Without comparing the animals, it
  is difficult to distinguish this genus from some species of Littorina.

  <p>ATRYPA, Dalman. A genus of brachiopodous bivalves, distinguished by
  the valves being nearly equal, and the umbones not separated by an
  intermediate area. A. reticulata, fig 302.</p>

  <p>ATTACHED. Shells are attached to marine substances by various means;
  in some cases by a <i>byssus</i>, or a bunch of tendinous fibres passing
  through an opening between the valves, which gape at their margins to
  admit a free passage, as in the genera Byssoarca and Mytilus. In other
  cases the byssus is of a more compact substance, and passes through a
  perforation in the shell itself. This is the case with many of the
  brachiopodous shells, in some species of which the perforation is in the
  point of the umbones, a specimen of which is represented in the
  Introduction. This species of attachment does not keep the animal
  motionless, although it is confined to a particular spot. Other shells
  are attached by a portion of their own substance, as in Chama, Spondylus,
  Serpula, &amp;c. in which instances, the attached valve is motionless,
  and is termed the under valve. The Pedunculated Cirripedes are attached
  by a tubular tendinous process, called a peduncle.</p>

  Ovulum Volva, fig. 442.</p>

  <p>ATYS. Montf. A generic name including those species of <span
  class="sc">Bulla</span>, which are described as "convolute, with the last
  whorl covering the rest and hiding the spire, the apex rounded at both
  ends." Bulla Naucum, Auct. fig. 250.</p>

  <p>AURICLE. (A little ear.) See <span class="sc">Auriculated</span>.</p>

  <p>AURICULA. Lam. (Dim. from <i>Auris</i> an ear.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Auriculacea. Bl. Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval or oblong,
  cylindrical or conical; aperture long, narrow, generally narrowest in the
  centre; rounded anteriorly, with two or three strong folds on the inner
  lip, and the outer lip thickened, reflected or denticulated; spire short,
  obtuse, epidermis horny, brown.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The above description
  includes the A. coniformis, f. 298. and several other conical species
  with narrow apertures which formed the genus <i>Melampus</i>, Montf. and
  <i>Conovulus</i>, Lam. The latter author suppressed his genus on
  ascertaining the Conovuli to be land shells. We exclude, however, the A.
  Dombeyana, Lam. f. 300. and several similar species, which being more
  rounded, having thin outer lips and but one fold on the columella, are
  described under the generic name <i>Chilina</i>, Gray. It appears rather
  doubtful whether the Auriculæ are marine or fluviatile, but the animals
  appear to be amphibious. The Auriculæ are principally found in Salt
  Marshes of Tropical climates, some small species are found on the
  Southern European Coasts, as far north as Britain and south as Tierra del
  Fuego. The Auriculæ formed a part of the genus Voluta of Linnæus, f. 297.
  A. Judæ, f. 298. A. Coniformis.</p>

  <p>AURICULATED. Some bivalve shells, such as <i>Pecten</i>, fig. 171,
  172, have a flat, broad, somewhat triangular appendage on one or both
  sides of the umbones, called an <i>auricle</i>, or little <i>ear</i>. If
  on one side only, they are said to be <i>uni-auriculated</i>; if on both,
  they are said to be <i>bi-auriculated</i>.</p>

  <p>AURICULACEA. Bl. The second family of the order Pulmobranchiata, thus
  described; "shell thick, solid; aperture more or less oval, always large,
  rounded anteriorly, and contracted by teeth or folds on the columella."
  This family is included in the genus Voluta of Linnæus, on account of the
  plaited columellar lip, a character by which that heterogeneous
  assemblage of shells is distinguished. It forms part of the family of
  <i>Colimacea</i>, Lam. from which they differ not only in general form,
  but also in the fact of the animals being partly amphibious, always
  living (according to De Blainville) on the sea shore, and being
  occasionally covered with water for a short time. It contains the genera
  Pedipes, Auricula, Pyramidella.</p>

  <p>AURISCALPIUM. Megerle. <span class="sc">Anatina</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>AVICULA. Lam. (From <i>Avis</i>, a bird). <i>Fam.</i> Malleacea, Lam.
  Margaritacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve, inequilateral,
  foliaceous, subquadrate, oblique, pearly; hinge rectilinear, lengthened
  into auricular appendages, with a small indistinct tooth in each valve,
  an elongated, marginal, ligamentiferous area, and an hiatus in the left
  valve, for the passage of a byssus; one circular muscular impression,
  near the centre of each valve, with a series of smaller ones arranged in
  a line towards the umbones.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Meleagrinæ of Lamarck,
  Margaritiferæ, Schum. included in this description, consist of the more
  rounded species, and do not present the elegant obliquity of form, nor
  the wing-like auricles from which the genus Avicula receives its name.
  The Aviculæ are pearly within. From A. margaritifera, a young specimen of
  which is figured in the plates, fig. 164, is obtained oriental pearls.
  This is an example of Meleagrina. A. Hirundo, fig. 163, belongs to the
  genus Avicula of Lamarck. It is, however, needless to continue the
  separation. Aviculæ are from E. and W. Indies, Mexico, Coasts of the
  Pacific, Mediterranean, British Islands, &amp;c. Fossil species occur in
  the London clay, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>AXINUS. J. Sowerby.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, transverse;
  posterior side very short, rounded, with a long ligament, placed in a
  furrow, extending along the whole edge; anterior side produced,
  angulated, truncated, with a flattish <i>lunule</i> near the beaks. The
  late Mr. James Sowerby, who described this shell in the Mineral
  Conchology, did not consider his genus as established, not having seen
  the hinge.</p>

  <p>AXIS. The imaginary line, round which the whorls of a spiral shell
  revolve. The extremities of the axis are pointed out in fig. 379, by the
  letters, <i>a. a.</i> See "<span class="sc">Columella</span>."</p>

  <p>AZECA. Leach. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> "Animal
  like Bulinus, with subcylindrical, rather obtuse shell, covered with a
  polished periostraca (epidermis); aperture pear-shaped, curved and
  pointed at the top; the margin thick, obtuse, united all round and
  toothed; the axis imperforated." Gray's edition of Turton's British
  Shells, page 189.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Turbo Tridens of Montagu, upon
  which this genus is founded, resembles Bulinus lubricus in general form
  and character. Both these shells differ from the true Bulini in having
  the peritreme entire, and in being pellucid and glossy. Azeca differs
  from Bulinus lubricus in having three teeth in the aperture, two on the
  inner lip and one on the outer. Not seeing the necessity for creating a
  genus on grounds so slight, I have simply transcribed the description
  given above, leaving others to form their own conclusions as to the
  propriety of separating this shell from the genus Bulinus. Britain,
  Central and Southern Europe. Azeca Tridens, fig. 290.</p>

  <p>AZEMUS. Ranzani. <span class="sc">Conia</span>, Leach.</p>

  <p>BACULITES. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Bl. Ammonacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Straight, conical, tubular, laterally
  compressed; chambers divided by very sinuous lobed septa, the last
  elongated; aperture elliptical; siphon dorsal.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This
  genus differs from Orthoceras in the same manner in which Ammonites
  differs from Nautilus, having its septa sinuated and branched. A Baculite
  might be described as a straight Ammonite. This genus is known only in a
  fossil state. It is found in the Cretaceous Limestone of Maëstricht and
  Valognes. Fig. 484. B. Faujasii.</p>

  <p>BALANUS. Brug. (an Acorn; "gland de Mer." Fr.) <i>Order</i> Sessile
  Cirripedes, Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Balanidea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Shell
  composed of six valves articulated to each other side by side in a
  circle, by the insertion of lamina; closed at the base by a flat,
  cylindrical or cup-shaped valve, by which it is generally attached; and
  at the apex by a conical operculum, consisting of four valves in anterior
  and posterior pairs. Each valve of the shell is divided into a rough
  triangular portion pointed towards the apex, and a flat area on each
  side.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This description includes the <i>Acasta</i> of
  Leach, which growing in sponges, has the base cup-shaped; <i>Conoplæa</i>
  of Say, which being attached to the stems of Gorgonia and sea-weeds has
  the base elongated and lanceolate, and <i>Chirona</i>, Gray. Balanus is
  the only genus of Sessile Cirripedes the shells of which consist of six
  parietal valves, except <i>coronula</i>, which has no shelly base, is
  flatter, and has the valves of the operculum placed horizontally. The
  Balani are common in all seas, adhering to rocks, corals, floating
  timber, and to each other. The fossil species are found in the newest
  strata, at Bordeaux, Paris, &amp;c. Fig. 25. B. Tintinnabulum; 26.
  <i>Acasta</i> Montagui; 27. Balanus galeatus, <i>Conoplæa</i>, Say.</p>

  <p>BALANIDEA. Bl. The second family of the class Nematopoda, Bl.
  corresponding with Sessile Cirripedes, Lam., and consisting of Coronular
  Multivalves, which are fixed, and in a manner soldered to submarine
  substances, by the base of the shell; as distinguished from the
  Lepadicea, Bl., Pedunculated Cirripedes, Lam., which are attached by a
  fleshy stalk. The Balanidea are composed of two sets of valves, besides
  the shelly plate or base on which they rest. The first, called the
  Parietal valves, are arranged so as to surround the body of the animal;
  the second, called the Opercular valves, are placed horizontally, so as
  to cover the aperture.</p>

  <p>BALEA. Gray. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Spiral,
  turrited, concentrically striated, sinistral, and covered with a thin
  brown epidermis; spire composed of numerous whorls, gradually increasing
  in size; aperture small, sub-quadrate; peritrême entire, slightly
  thickened, with a very slight fold on the columella; axis
  perforated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> A genus of small land shells, found in moss
  at the roots of trees in Britain, not very nearly resembling any other
  land shells, except Clausilia, from which they differ in not having the
  clausium. They have been placed in Helix by De Ferrusac, and in Pupa by
  Draparnaud. B. fragilis, fig. 296. <i>Helix perversa</i>, Fer. <i>Pupa

  Called Anatifa, by Linnæus and Lamarck, from the ancient notion that they
  were the eggs or embryo of the Barnacle Duck. See <span
  class="sc">Anatifer</span>.</p>

  <p>BASE. In all shells which are attached to sub-marine substances, the
  base is that part of the shell which forms the point of
  attachment,&mdash;as for instance, the attached valve of Spondylus, the
  basal plate of Balanus, the lower part of the peduncle of Pentelasmis; in
  Unattached Bivalves, the margin opposite to the umbones, where the foot
  of the animal, or the part analogous to it, protrudes; in spiral
  univalves, the aperture, which rests on the back of the animal when
  walking. Lamarck and some other authors have used the term <i>base</i> as
  simply opposed to apex, and apply it to the anterior of the aperture.</p>

  <p>BATOLITES. Montf. <span class="sc">Hippurites</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>BEAK. The Apices, or points of the valves of a bivalve shell,

  any part which is rostrated or drawn out like a beak.</p>

  <p>BEAKED. See <span class="sc">Beak</span> and <span

  <p>BELEMNITES. Auct. (<span title="Belemnon" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&epsilon;&lambda;&epsilon;&mu;&nu;&omicron;&nu;</span>,
  <i>belemnon</i>, a dart, or arrow.) <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Bl. and
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Straight, conical, consisting of two parts; the
  <i>external</i> portion forming a thick solid sheath, with a cavity at
  the base to admit the internal portion or nucleus, which is
  mathematically conical, and is divided into chambers by smooth simple
  septa perforated by a lateral siphon.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> These singular
  fossils, which are found in most secondary beds, have long attracted the
  attention of philosophers as well as of the ignorant, from whom they have
  received the various appellations of Thunder-Stones, Petrified Arrows,
  Petrified Fingers, Devil's Fingers, Spectre Candles, &amp;c. The above
  description is framed to include the genera Hibolithes, Porodragus,
  Cetocis, Acamas, and Paclites of De Montfort, and Actinocamax, Stokes.
  Fig. 466 to 468.</p>

  <p>BELLEROPHON. Montf. (or Bellerophus).&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Convolute,
  symmetrical, umbilicated, with a double dorsal ridge; aperture wide,
  semilunar.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The fossils composing this genus resemble
  Nautilus in general appearance, but not being chambered shells they
  approach very near to Argonauta, from which they differ only in the
  thickness of their shell and in roundness of their external form. This
  genus is erroneously placed by De Montfort among chambered shells, and by
  De Blainville next to Bulla. It belongs to the Monothalamous Cephalopoda
  of Lamarck. This fossil is found principally in the Carboniferous
  Limestone. Fig. 486, 487, represent B. tenuifasciata.</p>

  <p>BELOPTERA. The bony support of a species of Cuttlefish, partly
  resembling Sepia.</p>

  <p>BIAPHOLIUS. Leach. A genus believed to be identical with Hiatella.</p>

  <p>BI-AURICULATED. Having two auricles placed at the sides of the
  umbones, as in Pecten, fig. 171. See <span
  class="sc">Auriculated</span>.</p>

  <p>BICATILLUS. Sw. A sub-genus of "Calyptrædæ," including those species,
  which have cup-shaped internal septa, as for example, Calyptræa
  extinctorium, fig. 235.</p>

  <p>BICONIA. Sw. A sub-genus of "Calyptrædæ," including those species in
  which the septum is partly spiral.</p>

  <p>BIFID. Divided, double.</p>

  <p>BIFRONTIA. Deshayes. Also <span class="sc">Omalaxis</span>, Desh.
  <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Discoidal,
  planorbicular, with whorls sometimes not contiguous; umbilicus deep,
  keeled at the margin; aperture subtriangular, somewhat dilated; outer lip
  acute, separated by a deep notch at both extremities.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  We do not see any reason for separating this genus from <span
  class="sc">Solarium</span>, except the last mentioned character. The few
  fossil species which this genus contains (Solarium disjunctum, Bifrons,
  &amp;c.) are found principally in the Paris basin. Fig. 354. Solarium
  Bifrons.</p>

  <p>BI-FURCATE. Double pronged, or having two points. <i>Ex.</i> the
  internal appendage of Calyptræa Equestris, fig. 234.</p>

  <p>BIGENERINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>BILABIATED. Having the edge of the outer lip as it were doubled, by
  one part of the lip being more thickened and reflected than the other, so
  as to form a ledge, or second lip.</p>

  <p>BILOBATE. Having two prominent parts, as the outer lip of Rostellaria
  Pes-Peleeani, fig. 404.</p>

  <p>BIPARTITE. Composed of or divided into two parts; double; as the
  valves of Platylepas, fig. 19, each of which has a septiform division in
  the centre; also the area on the hinge of Spondylus. See
  Frontispiece.</p>

  <p>BIROSTRA. Sw. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Ovulum</span>, which have elongated extremities, as, for
  instance, Ovulum Volva, fig. 442.</p>

  <p>BIROSTRITES. Lam. (Double Beak.) A fossil formerly considered as a
  distinct bivalve shell, with conical umbones, and placed in the family of
  Rudistes by Lamarck, but now known to be an internal cast of Sphærulites,
  fig. 196.</p>

  <p>BISIPHYTES. Described by De Montfort as resembling a Nautilus, but
  having two distinct siphons. As no such fossil species is now known to
  Naturalists, it appears probable that De Montfort having a specimen of
  some Nautilus, with an accidental depression, took it for a second
  siphon.</p>

  <p>BITHINIA. Gray. A genus described as differing from <span
  class="sc">Paludina</span>, in having the operculum shelly, and the mouth
  of the shell thickened internally. <span class="sc">Paludina</span>
  impura, Auct. Fig. 537.</p>

  <p>BITOMUS. Montf. A microscopic shell, deriving this general
  appellation, from the appearance of a double aperture.</p>

  <p>BIVALVE. A shell composed of two equal, or nearly equal principal
  parts, each part having a separate nucleus, turning upon each other by
  means of a hinge. The class Conchifera of Lamarck, Acephalophora of De
  Blainville severally include the whole of the bivalve shells; the latter
  name being derived from the fact that the animals have not distinct
  heads, and neither eyes nor tentacula. All bivalve shells are marine or
  fresh-water. They form the class Dithyra of Aristotle. It may be observed
  that some of the Acephalophora, the Pholades, for example, have small
  testaceous pieces fixed on the hinge, which are called accessary valves.
  These are still fairly bivalve shells, although the genus Pholas has been
  placed by some writers among the multivalves.</p>

  <p>BOAR'S TUSK. A common name given to shells of the genus Dentalium. One
  particular species has received a specific name in accordance with a
  supposed resemblance, namely, Dentalium Aprinum, (of a Boar.)</p>

  <p>BONELLIA. Desh. A genus formed, in the first instance, for the
  reception of Bulinus terebellatus, Lam. which Mr. G. B. Sowerby, in his
  Genera of Shells, united with the genus <span
  class="sc">Pyramidella</span>. M. Deshayes, however, in his new edition
  of Lamarck, makes the genus Bonellia include several species which I have
  arranged in the genus Eulima. From the remarks of M. Deshayes, tom. 8, p.
  286, 287, we are led to suppose that the estimated difference between
  Eulima and Bonellia consists in the latter having the axis perforated; or
  in other words, umbilicated. After remarking "que Mr. Sowerby, junr.
  confond deux choses bien distinctes, sous le nomme d'Eulima," M. Deshayes
  gives the following description of his genus, (translated) "shell
  turriculated, smooth, polished, with the apex acute and laterally
  inclined; axis perforated throughout its length; aperture small, entire,
  angular at the extremities; columella simple and without folds; outer lip
  thin, simple, nearly parallel with the longitudinal axis." That author
  further remarks, "Mr. Sowerby, junr. à signalé cinque espèces vivant, que
  nous rapportons à notre genre." (Sowerby, junr. Conchological
  Illustrations, parts 52 and 53; 50, Great Russell Street, Bloomsbury.)
  The species thus selected are E. splendidula, E. marmorata, E.
  interrupta, E. imbricata, E. brunnea; the two last of which have the
  umbilicus so inconsiderable, as to be scarcely distinguishable from other
  species, which M. Deshayes has left in the genus Eulima, and which have a
  slight hollow, almost approaching to a perforation, behind the columella.
  Eulima marmorata, (Bonellia, Desh.) is figured in the plates, fig.
  348.</p>

  <p>BODY WHORL. The last whorl, constituting the bulk of the shell.</p>

  <p>BORELIS. Montf. <span class="sc">Melonia</span>, Bl. A genus of
  microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>BORER or PIERCER. A term applied to those species of Acephalopodous
  Mollusca, which bore holes as dwellings in the rocks, as the Pholades,
  and some others.</p>

  <p>BRACHIOPODA. Lam. A family of symmetrical bivalves belonging to the
  third section of Lamarck's <i>order</i> "Conchifera Monomyaria,"
  described as bivalve (generally symmetrical) adhering to marine bodies,
  by a tendon passing through the shell, having no true ligament. What most
  distinguishes this family and renders it remarkable is the structure of
  the animal. It has two elongated, tendril-shaped arms. When the animal is
  in a state of repose these arms are coiled up spirally and enclosed in
  the shell, but when required for use, are unfolded and extended. This
  family contains the genera Orbicula, Terebratula and Lingula, in the
  system of Lamarck, to which may be added Thecidium, Productus, Spirifer,
  Magas, Pentamerus, Crania, Strigocephalus, Strophomena, and some others
  enumerated in the explanation of figures 201 to 219. The above genera may
  be thus distinguished.</p>

  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval or oblong, light, covered with a thin
  epidermis; spire obtuse, variable in length and in the number of whorls,
  which are generally few; aperture wide, oval, rounded anteriorly; outer
  lip simple, usually reflected, joining the columella without a sinus;
  inner lip reflected over part of the body-whorl. The Bulini are land
  shells, found in many parts of the world.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The genus
  Bulinus can only be distinguished from Helix by its oval form; it forms
  part of the genus Helix of De Ferrusac, under the sub-generic designation
  of Cochlostyla. It is known from Achatina by the absence of the notch at
  the point of union between the inner and the outer lips. The young are
  produced from eggs, which are as firm and opaque as those of birds. (See
  Introduction.) Bulinus rosaceus, fig. 282. B. Guadaloupensis, fig. 283.
  B. Lionetianus, fig. 284. B. lubricus, fig. 285. Many new species were
  brought to this country by Mr. Cuming, and are represented in the
  Conchological Illustrations, published by the Author at 50, Great Russell
  Street, Bloomsbury, (in parts 21, 22, 23, 26, 27, 30, 31, 34, 35, 137 to
  146, 185, 186.) Species occur in Europe, West Indies, Brazil, and South
  America generally. Some small species are British.</p>

  <p>BULLA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> "Bulléens," Lam. Akera,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Generally thin, smooth, oval, oblong or
  cylindrical, more or less convolute; spire short, depressed, or hidden by
  the last whorl; aperture long, wide in front, gradually narrowing towards
  the spire; outer lip thin; inner lip spread over a part of the last
  whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells composing this genus are very
  variable in form. The light horny species with an elastic lip is called
  Akera, fig. 247. The more decidedly convolute species with hidden spires
  are the Atys, Montf. B. Naucum, fig. 250. B. Lignaria, fig. 251, is
  Scaphander of Leach. The light, thin species, with extremely wide
  aperture, fig. 248, is Bullæa aperta, Lam. The genus Bullinula of Dr.
  Beck, consists of those species which have more produced spines, fig.
  253. The Bullæ are marine, and inhabit all climates. The fossil species
  occur in tertiary beds.</p>

  <p>BULLÆA. Lam. <span class="sc">Bulla</span> aperta, Auct. fig. 248.</p>

  <p>BULLÆANA. ("Bulléens, Lam.") A family belonging to the first section
  of Lamarck's order, Gasteropoda, containing the genus Bulla. The genera
  Bullæa, Akera, Aplustra, Atys, Scaphander, Bullinula, into which it has
  been divided, may all be fairly included under the name <span
  class="sc">Bulla</span>.</p>

  <p>BULLIA. Gray. A genus of shells partly resembling Buccinum, and
  Terebra in general form, being more elongated than the former and more
  ventricose than the latter. Mr. Gray remarks in the Synopsis of the
  British Museum, page 114, that the Bulliæ resemble the Nassæ in most
  characters, "but they have a very large, broad foot, and the hinder part
  of the inner lip of the shell being extended beyond the mouth, forms a
  raised enamelled band round the suture of the whorls, as is also the case
  with the Ancillariæ and some Volutes." Bullia vittata, fig. 427, is an
  example of the genus. The name Subula is given by De Blainville to the
  other species of Terebra, so that if both these genera were admitted, the
  old genus Terebra must be expunged.</p>

  <p>BULLINULA. Beck. Species of <span class="sc">Bulla</span>, with
  produced conical spires, fig. 253.</p>

  <p>BYSSOARCA. Sw. (<i>Byssus</i> and <i>Arca</i>.) <i>Fam.</i> Arcacea,
  Lam. A genus of bivalve shells, composed of the Arca <i>Noæ</i>, and
  several other species, separated from the genus Arca on account of their
  shells being attached by means of a byssus passing through an hiatus in
  the ventral margins. B. <i>Noæ</i>, fig. 132. The species occur in
  Southern Europe, East and West Indies, China; also, on the coasts of
  Great Britain.</p>

  <p>BYSSOMYA. Cuvier. (<i>Byssus</i> and <i>Mya</i>.) De Blainville states
  that although the shell of this proposed genus resembles Saxicava, the
  animal is sufficiently different to justify the separation.</p>

  <p>BYSSUS. (<span title="Bussos" class="grk"
  >&Beta;&upsilon;&sigma;&sigma;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>byssus</i>,
  ancient name for linen.) The tendinous fibres by which some Bivalves are
  as it were anchored or moored to sub-marine substances. A fine example of
  this is to be seen in the Pinnæ which bear some resemblance to large
  Muscle Shells and have an hiatus in the margins of the valves through
  which a bunch of silken fibres passes. In the British Museum there is
  preserved a pair of gloves which have been woven of these fibres. The
  Byssus is peculiar to some bivalve shells such as Muscles, Hammer
  Oysters, Arca Noæ, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>CALCAR. Montf. (a spur.) A genus composed of <span class="sc">Trochus
  stellaris</span>, Lam. and other depressed species of Trochus which are
  characterized by a stellated keel round the angle of the last whorl; but
  not including T. Imperialis, which is the genus Imperator, Montf. The
  difference consists in the latter being umbilicated and the former not.
  T. stellaris, fig. 358.</p>

  <p>CALCAREOUS, (<i>calx</i>, lime.) A term applied to a shell or to its
  operculum which is composed principally of lime or shelly matter, as is
  usually the case, in distinction from one which is of an horny,
  membranaceous texture. The greater number of shells are calcareous, but
  it forms an important point of distinction with regard to the operculum.
  The only difference between the genera Trochus and Turbo, as at present
  established, depends upon the calcareous or shelly, and the corneus or
  horny texture of the operculum.</p>

  <p>CALCEOLA. <i>Fam.</i> Rudistes, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equilateral, inequivalve, triangular; umbones separated by a large
  triangular disc in the lower valve; cardinal margin straight, linear,
  dentated; lower valve large, deep; upper valve flat, semi-orbicular,
  forming a kind of operculum to the lower.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This singular
  shell, known only in a fossil state, in the Palæozöic beds, is placed by
  Linnæus in the genus Anomia. Lamarck places it among his Rudistes, but
  Mr. Sowerby in his genera of Shells, states that it should be added to
  the family of Brachiopoda. Fig. 194, 195. C. Sandalina.</p>

  <p>CALLANTICA. Gray. <span class="sc">Pollicipes</span> hispidus,
  Leach.</p>

  <p>CALLIA. Gray? A genus described as having a peculiarly polished shell
  like Pupina, but wanting the notch.</p>

  <p>CALLISOSTOMA. Sw. A genus of shells separated from <span
  class="sc">Trochus</span>, and thus described, "Imperforate; spire
  elevated, acute; aperture broader than high, transversely ovate, hardly
  sinuated at the base, and slightly oblique; shells always smooth, and
  often polished." C. zizyphina is mentioned as an example.</p>

  <p>CALLIRHOE. Montf. p. 362, vol. 2. Appears to be figured from the nut
  or inner portion of a large Belemnite.</p>

  <p>CALLISCAPHA. Gray? <span class="sc">Iridina</span> Nilotica, Sow.
  Zool. Journ. 1. pl. 2. Separated from Iridina on account of the hinge
  margin being smooth.</p>

  <p>CALLITHEA. Sw. A sub-genus of Mitræ, consisting of those species,
  which like M. sanguisuga, have the "spire and aperture of nearly equal
  length; internal channel nearly obsolete; shell with longitudinal linear
  ribs, crossed by transverse striæ and bands; base contracted." Swainson
  Mallac. Lard. Cyclop.</p>

  <p>CALLOSITY. A term used in general zoology to express those hard horny
  tumidities formed in the skin of some animals, (such as the Dromedary,
  for instance) in those parts which are most frequently used. It is not
  used in this sense by Conchologists, who apply it to those undefined
  tumidities or bumps which appear on the inner surface and hinge of some
  bivalve shells, and to the thickening over the umbilicus of Naticæ.
  Glycimeris, fig. 67. Natica, fig. 327, 328.</p>

  <p>CALPURNUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Ovulum</span> <i>verrucosum</i>,
  Auct. Distinguished by the small circular tubercle at the back of each
  extremity of the shell. Fig. 441.</p>

  <p>CALYPTRACEA. Lam. A family belonging to the first section of the order
  Gasteropoda, Lam., the shells of which are described as always external,
  covering the animal, and having no operculum. The genera contained in
  this family may be thus distinguished.</p>

  <p>CARDILIA. Desh. <i>Fam.</i> Cardiacea, Lam. A genus formed for the
  reception of Isocardia semi-sulcata, Lam. and a small fossil shell, which
  Deshayes had formerly named Hemi-cyclonosta Michelini; thus described,
  (translation) "shell oval, oblong, longitudinal, white, heart-shaped,
  ventricose, with large prominent umbones; hinge with a small cardinal
  tooth and a pit at the side; a spoon-shaped projection for the reception
  of the internal ligament; anterior muscular impression rounded, not deep;
  the posterior being upon a thin, horizontal lamina, projecting in the
  anterior." Deshayes further remarks that although the animal is unknown,
  the relations of the genus may be established by means of the shell
  alone. Two families contain all the shells which have the internal
  ligament inserted in a spoon-shaped projection; in the one, that of the
  Anatinæ, the ligament is supported upon a little bone, which is not
  soldered to the hinge; in the other, that of the Mactraceæ, this little
  bone has no existence. In the former, all the shells are inequivalve; in
  the latter equivalve. And M. Deshayes, considering that the valves are
  equal, and that there is no separate bone to the hinge, is of opinion
  that the genus ought to be placed near the Lutrariæ, and not far from the
  Anatinæ. C. semisulcata, fig. 501, 2.</p>

  443.</p>

  <p>CARINELLA. Adanson. <span class="sc">Lutraria</span> papyracea, Lam.
  <span class="sc">Ligula</span>, Leach. <i>Fam.</i> Mactracea, Lam. Fig.
  77.</p>

  <p>CARINIDEA. Sw. A sub-genus of the genus Canthorbis, Sw. (Turbo.) thus
  described, "Imperforate; spire pyramidal, acute; basal whorl concave
  beneath, and carinated round its circumference; aperture oval, entire,
  slightly angulated at the base of the pillar, which turns inwards. C.
  concavus, Martini, 168, fig. 1620, brevispinosus? Sow. Gen. (Turbo,) fig.
  1."</p>

  <p>CAROCOLLA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Orbicular, depressed, with the outer sides of the whorls angulated or
  keeled, whorls few; peritreme reflected; columella contiguous to the
  axis; epidermis thin.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus differing from Helix
  only in the whorls being angulated, is hardly distinct enough from the
  latter to justify the separation. In De Ferrusac's system these species
  constitute the division Helicigona, of the genus Helix. C. Lamarckii,
  fig. 277. East and West Indies, Philippines, South America and
  Europe.</p>

  <p>CARTILAGE. See <span class="sc">Ligament</span>.</p>

  <p>CARYCHIUM. Müll. <i>Fam.</i> Auriculacea, Bl. Colimacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oblong or cylindrical, with gradually increasing
  whorls, few in number; aperture straight, short, with a fold on the
  columella.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of minute land shells differs
  from Auricula chiefly in the soft parts. De Furrusac enumerates three
  species, C. Lineatum, C. Corticaria, (<i>Odostomia</i>, Flem.) and C.
  Minimum, fig. 301. De Blainville places it in his genus Auricula, as
  "species with two folds and a posterior tooth on the columella," giving a
  figure of A. Mysotis as his example, and quoting the name Phitia, Gray.
  Europe.</p>

  <p>CASSIDARIA. Lam. (From Cassis) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.
  Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, ventricose, spirally grooved
  and tuberculated, with a short turrited spire and a large aperture,
  terminating anteriorly in a recurved canal; outer lip thickened,
  reflected, undulated or denticulated; inner lip expanded over a part of
  the body whorl and the columella, with part of its lower edge
  free.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The recent species of this genus are not
  numerous; the few fossil species occur in the tertiary strata. C.
  carinata is found in Calc-grossier and London Clay. In general form this
  resembles <span class="sc">Cassis</span>, but is at once distinguished by
  the canal, which does not turn abruptly back, but is slightly curved
  upwards. <span class="sc">Oniscia</span> (C. Oniscus, &amp;c. Lam.) is
  distinguished by the shortness of the canal, and the granulated surface
  of the inner lip. Fig. 407. C. Echinophora. Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>CASSIDEA. Sw. (from Cassis.) A genus composed of those species of the
  genus <span class="sc">Cassis</span>, Auct. which have the "aperture
  wide; outer lip never broad or flattened, but sometimes slightly
  inflected; inner lip spreading, but never dilated or detached beyond the
  base into a prominent rim." East Indies. Ex. C. Glauca, fig. 411.</p>

  <p>CASSIDULA. Humph. <span class="sc">Pyrula</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>CASSIDULINA. D'Orbigny. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>CASSIS. (A helmet.) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam. Entomostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval or triangular, ventricose, thick, generally
  tuberculated, with a short varicose spire; aperture long, sometimes
  narrow, with the outer lip thickened and reflected, generally
  denticulated; the inner lip spread over the surface of the body whorl,
  indented and incrassated at its inner edge; canal turned suddenly over
  the back of the shell. <i>Hab.</i> Seas of tropical climates. The fossil
  species are rare, occurring in the tertiary strata.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  large, common species of this well known genus are used for shell cameos
  and as ornaments on chimney pieces, grottos, &amp;c. and are remarkable
  for the triangular disc, presented by the inner lip, which, in many
  species, is thickened and spread over the front of the body whorl and the
  angulated outer lip. The smaller, more rounded species, which have
  widened apertures, have been separated by Swainson, under the generic
  name <span class="sc">Cassidea</span>. The C. rufa, coarctata, &amp;c.
  are formed by Mr. Stutchbury into a new genus under the name <span
  class="sc">Cypræcassis</span>, for reasons which will be stated under the
  word. Cassidaria is distinguished by the gradual curve of the canal. Fig.
  410 is Cassis tuberosa, diminished.</p>

  <p>CASTALIA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Trigonées, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Fluviatile, equivalve, inequilateral, trigonal, with corroded umbones;
  hinge with two laminar, transversely striated teeth, one of which is
  posterior, remote from the umbones, short, divided, the other anterior,
  elongated; epidermis thick; internal surface pearly. Lamarck, in
  describing this shell, states, that he regards it as intermediate between
  Trigonia and Unio. It should, however, certainly have been placed in the
  family of "Nayades," and perhaps should form a part of the genus <span
  class="sc">Unio</span> itself. C. ambigua, Lam. fig. 140. South
  America.</p>

  >&phi;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span> <i>a place</i>
  <i>paled in</i>.) <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Light principal valves, cemented side by side in
  a circle; eight small pointed valves beneath, covering the joints of the
  upper circle, and numerous still smaller valves forming the base of the
  shell; operculum, four valves.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is the only genus
  of Sessile Cirripedes, consisting of eight principal valves, excepting
  Octomeris, which is destitute of the accessary pieces from which the
  genus derives its name. Fig. 23. C. imbricatus. South Africa.</p>

  <p>CAUDAL CANAL. The elongated hollow process which terminates the
  aperture anteriorly of some univalve shells. For instance, Murex
  Haustellum, fig. 396, has an elongated caudal canal.</p>

  <p>CELLANTHUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Vorticialis</span>, Bl. A genus of
  microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>CELLULACEA. Bl. The second order of Cephalophora, Bl. consisting of
  doubtful microscopic bodies, with a number of variously arranged shells,
  as distinguished from the true Polythalamia, Bl. or chambered shells. See
  <span class="sc">Foraminifera</span>.</p>

  <p>CEMORIA. Flemingii. Leach. A small patelliform shell, differing from
  Fissurella, in having the fissure placed behind the apex, which is
  produced, pointed and incurved. It is the Patella Fissurella, Müll.
  Patella Noachina, Chemn. F. Noachina, Sow. Puncturella, Lowe. Fig. 244.
  Cemoria Flemingii. Scotland and Tierra del Fuego.</p>

  <p>CENTRAL. A term used to indicate the position of the muscular
  impression of a bivalve shell when it is near the centre of the inner
  surface. It is also applied to the siphon perforating the septum of a
  chambered shell when it is placed near the centre of the plate.
  <i>Sub</i><span class="nw">-central</span> is also used as a comparative
  term, to indicate the position of the siphon, or of the muscular
  impression, is <i>near</i> the centre. Thus in Placuna (fig. 184), the
  muscular impression is central: in Exogyra (fig. 183), it is
  <i>sub</i><span class="nw">-central.</span></p>

  <p>CEPA. Humph. <span class="sc">Anomia</span>, Linn.</p>

  <p>CEPHALOPHORA. Bl. The first class of Malacozoæ, Bl. Divided into:
  <i>Order</i> 1. Cryptodibranchiata; 2. Cellulacea; 3. Polythalamacea. The
  first consisting of Cuttle-fish, &amp;c. which are destitute of shells;
  the second composed of those microscopic cellular bodies, which are
  regarded as shells by some authors; and the third containing the true
  chambered shells.</p>

  <p>CEPHALOPODA. Lam. (Cephalopodes.) (<span title="Kephalê" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&epsilon;&phi;&alpha;&lambda;&eta;</span>, <i>kephale</i>, head;
  <span title="pous" class="grk">&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <span title="podos" class="grk"
  >&pi;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>podos</i>, foot.) The
  fourth order of the <i>class</i> Mollusca, Lam. containing molluscs,
  which are characterized by having a series of arms surrounding the head,
  which is placed above a sack-shaped body. This order is divided into
  Polythalamia, or many-chambered shells; Monothalamia, or single-chambered
  cephalopods; and Sepiaria, or cuttle-fish. Fig. 463 to 488.</p>

  <p>CEPOLIS. Montf. Belonging to the genus <span class="sc">Helix</span>,
  Auct.</p>

  <p>CERATODES. Guild. (<span title="Keratôdês" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&tau;&omega;&delta;&eta;&sigmaf;</span>,
  like a horn.) A genus composed of the flat, orbicular species of <span
  class="sc">Ampullaria</span>, Auct. which present so near a resemblance
  to the Planorbes, as to have been considered as belonging to them.
  Planorbis has, however, a horny texture, and no operculum, and it is
  always reversed, which may be observed by placing the spire upwards. Fig.
  320, represents Ampullaria (Ceratodes) Cornu-arietis.</p>

  <p>CERIPHASIA. Sw. A sub-genus of Melanianæ, thus described,
  "Cerithiform; outer lip thin, dilated at the base; aperture small,
  slightly emarginate, without any internal groove; inner lip thin. C.
  sulcata, Sw. fig. 38. p. 204." (Sw. Lard. Cyclop. Malac. p. 342.)</p>

  <p>CERITHIUM. Brug. <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam. Entomostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Desc.</i> Elongated, ribbed, tuberculated, or rarely smooth,
  with a lengthened, turrited, pointed, pyramidal spire, consisting of
  numerous whorls; aperture sub-quadrate, terminated anteriorly by a
  tortuous canal; outer lip thickened, sometimes reflected, expanded; inner
  lip thickened posteriorly; operculum horny, spiral, with numerous
  whorls.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The fresh-water shells described as Cerithia by
  Lamarck, are separated under the name Potamis, and may be known by the
  thick, horny epidermis. Triphora, Desh. has the canal closed, except at
  the extremities. Cerithium Telescopium, does not appear to present the
  same characters as the other Cerithia, and has been separated by some
  writers under the generic name Telescopium. Cerithium Aluco, fig. 372.
  Mediterranean, East and West Indies, Coasts of the Pacific, Gallapagos,
  Australia, &amp;c. Some small species are British. Fossils are numerous
  in the tertiary beds.</p>

  <p>CERVICOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The second order of Paracephalophora
  Hermaphrodita, Bl. containing symmetrical patelliform shells, divided
  into the families Retifera and Branchifera.</p>

  <p>CETOCIS. Montf. <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Lam. and Bl. Placed by De
  Blainville in his section of Belemnites, characterized as having small
  folds at the apex. <i>Ex.</i> B. Penicillatus.</p>

  <p>CETOPIRUS. Ranz. <span class="sc">Coronula Balænaris</span>, Auct.
  fig. 16.</p>

  <p>CHAMA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Chamacea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Inequivalve, irregular, thick, foliaceous, attached by the umbo of the
  lower and larger valve. External ligament placed in a groove, following
  the curve of the umbones. Umbones spiral, coiled round on the back of the
  valves; hinge with a thick, crenated, lengthened tooth, in one valve,
  entering a corresponding cavity in the hinge margin of the other;
  muscular impressions, two in each valve, distinct,
  lateral.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Linnæan genus Chama, included the
  beautiful shells now called Tridacna. These are exceedingly different
  from the true Chama, being regular and unattached. The Chama (Tridacna)
  gigas, when at its full age and development, is the largest shell known.
  Specimens have occurred weighing upwards of 500 lbs., and measuring two
  feet across. Diceras may be known from Chama by the spiral horns into
  which the umbones are produced; Isocardia, by the regularity of the
  shells, and it is hardly necessary to mention Spondylus, which may be
  known by the triangular disc between the umbones; Cleidothærus, Stutch.
  which resembles Chama in general form, has a separate bony appendage
  attached to the hinge, and may, moreover, be distinguished by its
  elongated muscular impression. Fig. 153, C. Lazarus. E. and W.
  Indies.</p>

  <p>CHAMACEA. Bl. The seventh family of the order Lamellibranchiata, Bl.
  containing the genera Chama, Diceras, Etheria, Tridacna, Isocardia and
  Trigonia.</p>

  <p>CHAMACEA. Lam. A family belonging to the order Conchifera Dimyaria,
  Lam. described as inequivalve, attached, irregular; with or without a
  single rough tooth on the hinge; with two lateral muscular impressions in
  each valve. This family contains the genera&mdash;</p>

  <p>CHAMBERED. When the cavity of a shell is not continuous, but is
  divided by shelly diaphragms or septa, it is said to be chambered. This
  is the case with the shells of the Polythalamous Cephalopoda, as in the

  parietal valves and two opercular valves; the upper edges of the parietal
  valves are sloped and the structure is not tubular.</p>

  <p>CHISMOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The second order of the first section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica, Bl. Those Mollusca belonging to this order
  which have shells, have them either internal or external, but always
  scutiform, with depressed spires and wide, haliotoid, oblique apertures,
  without a columellar lip properly so called. This order partly answers to
  the family <span class="sc">Macrostomata</span>, in the system of
  Lamarck. It contains the genera Coriocella, Sigaretus, Cryptostoma,
  Oxinoe, Stomatella and Velutina.</p>

  <p>CHITON. Auct. (<span title="chiton" class="grk"
  >&chi;&iota;&tau;&omicron;&nu;</span>, an integument.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Phyllidiana, Lam. <i>Class</i>, Polyplaniphora, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Oval, consisting of eight arched valves arranged in a series across the
  body of the animal and fixed in the skin which forms a rim around them,
  sometimes scaly, spinose, or rugose, sometimes smooth.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  The genus Chiton, commonly called "Coat of Mail," from its resemblance to
  jointed armour, remains to the present day in exactly the same state with
  regard to its boundaries as that in which Linnæus found it, and in which
  he left it. That illustrious Naturalist placed it among the multivalves
  in his purely Conchological system, although the animal is totally
  different from the Cirripedes. The shells are prettily marked, and are
  found attached to the rocks in all seas of Tropical and Southern
  climates, but fossil species are almost unknown. Fig. 227, C. Spinosus.
  The genus is divided by Guilding into Chiton, Canthopleura,
  Phakellopleura, Chitonellus and Cryptoconchus. Zool. Journ. <span
  class="sm">XVII.</span> p. 27. The author of this manual has lately
  attempted a revision of this interesting but neglected genus, and has
  given a catalogue of all the species hitherto known, as far as they could
  be identified among the confused mass of synonyms and descriptions to be
  found in the works of various Conchological writers. This catalogue is to
  be found in his Conchological Illustrations, and refers to figures of 102
  species, 92 of which are contained in parts 38 to 45, and 159 to 176.</p>

  <p>CHITONELLUS. Lam. (From <i>Chiton</i>) Separated by Lamarck from
  Chiton, on account of the valves being placed at a greater distance from
  each other, the soft integument of the animal intervening. Fig. 228, C.
  striatus. Philippines.</p>

  <p>CHLOROSTOMA. Sw. A sub-genus of "Trochinæ." Sw. (Trochus) of which C.
  argyrostoma is given as an example. Sw. Lard. Cyclop. p. 350.</p>

  <p>CHRYSOAR. Montf. Probably a species of <span
  class="sc">Orthoceras</span>.</p>

  <p>CHRYSODOMUS. Swains. "Distinguished from Fusus, by the comparative
  shortness of the basal channel, and the ventricose or enlarged shape of
  the body whorl. The beautiful orange-mouthed Whelk of England is a
  typical example; and the few others now known are all of a very large
  size, and chiefly found in Northern Seas, where they represent the more
  elegant Fusi of tropical latitudes; the outer lip is always thin and

  <p>CHTHALAMUS. Ranz. <i>Fam.</i> Balanidea, Bl. Order, Sessile
  Cirripedes, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> "Shell much depressed, valves thick,
  thickened at the base, with prominent areas; operculum nearly horizontal,
  composed of four valves."&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This description would apply
  generically to the shell called Platylepas in the British Museum, only
  nothing is said about the prominent plates jutting from the internal
  surface of the valves. The difference between this genus and <span
  class="sc">Balanus</span> consists principally in the horizontal position
  of the operculum, and general flatness of the shell. C. stellatus, fig.

  quadrilateral body, supported on a fleshy peduncle, with an opening in
  front of the upper part for the passage of a bunch of ciliated tentacula.
  Immediately above this aperture is a pair of small elongated valves,
  placed in a nearly horizontal position; at the lower part is another
  tripartite pair placed perpendicularly, one on each side, and a narrow,

  <p>CIRRIPEDES. Lam. The tenth class of invertebrated animals, so named
  from the curled and ciliated branchia which protrude from the oval
  aperture of the shells. The class Cirripedes of Lamarck constitutes the
  entire genus <i>Lepas</i> of Linnæus. They are divided into two sections;
  first, Sessile Cirr. attached by the basal portion of the shell; second,
  Pedunculated Cirr. supported upon a Peduncle. Figs. 14 to 45.</p>

  <p>CIRROBRANCHIATA. Bl. The first order of Paracephalophora
  Hermaphrodita, Bl. This order has been formed for the purpose of giving a

  lungs, consisting of numerous filaments, having their basal origin in two
  radical lobes under the neck.</p>

  <p>CIRRUS. J. Sowerby (cirrus, a tendril.) <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Bl.

  <p>CLAUSILIA. Drap. (<i>Clausium</i>, a valve or folding door.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam. Limacinea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Spire
  elongated, consisting of many volutions; aperture small, sub quadrate,
  having several tooth-shaped folds on the columella. A small, elastic,
  shelly plate, attached to the columella within, called the Clausium, its
  office being to enclose the aperture when the animal has retired within
  the shell.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This last character distinguishes it from
  the Pupæ, to some of which it bears a very near resemblance. <i>Hab.</i>
  Land, in the central and southern parts of Europe, several British
  species. Fig. 295, C. Macascarensis.</p>

  <p>CLAUSIUM. A name applied to the beautiful contrivance whence the genus
  Clausilia derives its name, consisting of a little bony tortuous plate,
  placed in a groove on the columella. Here it serves the purpose of a
  door, which, when not prevented by counteracting pressure, springs
  forward on its elastic ligament, and encloses the animal in his
  retirement. The aperture is opened by pushing back the clausium into the
  groove.</p>

  Pyloridea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Two irregular flattish valves, one
  fixed or soldered, so as to form part of the side of an irregular shelly
  tube; the other free within the tube near the base.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  shells composing this genus are found in stones, madrepores, &amp;c. and
  appear to form the connecting link between Aspergillum, which has both
  valves cemented into the tube; and Fistulana, in which both are free.

  South Wales.</p>

  <p>CLAVALITHES. Sw. A genus composed of some fossil shells, separated
  from the genus Fusus, which, having the general form of Turbinella Rapa,
  &amp;c. are considered by Swainson, as holding an intermediate station
  between Fusus and the Turbinellidæ.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> "Unequally
  sub-fusiform; the body whorl, and spire, being conic; and the canal
  suddenly contracted and attenuated; terminal whorls papillary; inner lip
  thick; pillar smooth, C. longævus, clavellatus, Noæ, ponderosus,
  Sw."&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The papillary spire may form a sufficient reason
  for separating this genus from Fusus, while the absence of plates on the
  columella places them at a still greater distance from Turbinella.</p>

  <p>CLAVATE. When one extremity of the shell is attenuated, and the other
  becomes suddenly ventricose or globular, it is said to be Clavate.
  <i>Ex.</i> Murex Haustellum, fig. 396.</p>

  <p>CLAVATULA. Lam. The generic name by which Lamarck originally
  distinguished those species of Pleurotoma which were remarkable for the
  shortness of their canals. In his system, however, they are re-united to
  Pleurotoma. Fig. 381, P. Strombiformis.</p>

  <p>CLAVICANTHA. Sw. A genus separated from Pleurotoma, Lam. consisting of
  species, which are described as "thick, sub-fusiform; the surface rugose,
  and the whorls sub-coronated; channel short; slit assuming the form of a
  short, broad sinus. C. imperialis, E. M. 440, spirata, E. M. 440, fig. 5,

  elongated, the other uniform.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell is like Chama
  in general form, but is distinguished by the clavicle or shelly appendage
  from which its name is derived. Fig. 75. New South Wales.</p>

  like that which joiners call dove-tailing. Operculum, consisting of two
  unequal pointed valves.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Clitia is known from Creusia,
  by the articulations of the valves, and by the operculum, which in
  Creusia consists of four valves. Fig. 20. C. Verruca, (Lepas Verruca,

  <p>CLOSE. The margins of a bivalve shell are described as being close,
  when there is no hiatus between them in any part, otherwise they are
  described as <i>gaping</i>.</p>

  <p>COLUMBELLA. Auct. (Columba, a dove.) <i>Fam.</i> Columellata,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thick, oval, or angular; with short spire, and
  long narrow aperture, contracted in the centre, and terminating in a
  short canal; outer lip thickened and dentated; inner lip irregularly
  crenated. Epidermis thin, brown. Operculum very small,
  horny.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Those species of Mitra, which resemble
  Columbella in shape, may easily be distinguished by the plaits on the
  columella. The Columbellæ are marine, and few fossil species are known.
  Fig. 430, C. Mercatoria. Swainson has divided this genus into the
  following: <i>Columbella</i>, consisting of C. Mercatoria, &amp;c.;
  <i>Pusiostoma</i>, consisting of the Strombiform species;
  <i>Crassispira</i>, which is most probably a Cerithium; <i>Nitidella</i>,
  consisting of the smooth species; <i>Conidea</i>, consisting of the more
  conical species; another set of the more conical species has been removed
  from this family, and placed in that of the "Coninæ," but as they are
  separated by no essential character, we suppose this has merely been done
  for the purpose of completing the "circle" of the last mentioned family,
  which otherwise would not have reached the required number of five.
  Mediterranean, East and West Indies, South America, Coast of California,
  Gallapagos, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>COLUMELLA. A solid column formed by the inner sides of the volutions
  of a spiral univalve. It is sometimes described as the inner lip of the
  aperture, of which it forms a part; but the term would be more properly
  confined to that portion of the inner lip which is seen below the body
  whorl, over which the remainder of the lip is frequently spread. All the
  inner edge of the aperture, including that part of it which covers the
  body whorl, is called the columellar lip. In fig. 431, the anterior
  termination of the columella is indicated by the letter <i>c</i>. The
  axis, is an imaginary line drawn strictly through the centre of the
  whorls, whether their inner edges form a solid column or not.</p>

  <p>COLUMELLAR LIP. The inner lip. See <span

  <p>COLUS. Humphrey. <span class="sc">Fusus</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>COMPLANARIA. Sw. A subgenus of <span class="sc">Alasmodon</span>
  (Unio), thus described, "shell winged; the valves connate; the bosses
  very small and depressed; cardinal teeth two or three; lateral teeth
  represented by irregular grooves. C. gigas (Unio), Sow. Man. fig. 141.
  Alasmodon complanatus, Say. C. rugosa, Sw."</p>

  <p>COMPRESSED. Pressed together, or flattened. The application is the
  same as in common use. A Patella may be described as a vertically
  compressed cone. A Ranella, on account of the two rows of varices
  skirting the whorls, appears, as it were, laterally compressed. A bivalve
  shell is said to be compressed when it is flat, that is, when but a small
  cavity is left in the deepest part when the valves are closed. Perhaps
  the Placuna placenta, fig. 184, is the most remarkable instance of
  this.</p>

  <p>CONCAMERATIONS. (<i>Con</i>, with, <i>camera</i>, a chamber.) A series
  of Chambers joining each other, as in Nautilus, Spirula, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>CONCENTRIC. A term applied to the direction taken by the lines of
  growth in spiral and other shells, (<i>longitudinal</i> of some authors.)
  Every fresh layer of shelly matter forms a new circle round an imaginary
  line, drawn through the centre of the spiral cone, down from the nucleus.
  When the edges of the successive layers are marked by any external
  characters, the shell is said to be concentrically striated, banded,
  grooved, costated, &amp;c. A fine illustration of the latter is to be
  seen in the Scalaria or Wentletrap, fig. 351, Lines, bands, ribs, &amp;c.
  in the opposite direction, (<i>transverse</i> of some authors,) are
  "radiating" in bivalves, as the ribs of Cardium, fig. 123, and "spiral"
  in univalves, that is, following the direction of the whorls, as the
  bands of colour in Pyramidella, fig. 342.</p>

  <p>CONCHACEA. Bl. The eighth family of the order Lamellibranchiata, Bl.
  The shells are described as follows: nearly always regular, valves closed
  all round; apices curved towards the anterior; dorsal hinge complete,
  with teeth and ligament; the latter external or internal, short and
  thick; two distinct muscular impressions, united at the lower part by a
  parallel impression, which is frequently sinuated at the posterior. The
  genera described in this family are divided into three sections. First,
  those which are regular, and have distant lateral teeth, Cardium, Donax,
  Tellina, Lucina, Cyclas, Cyprina, Mactra, and Erycina. Second, those
  which are regular, and have no distant lateral teeth, Crassatella and
  Venus. Third, those which are irregular, Venerupis, Coralliophaga,
  Clotho, Corbula, Sphænia, and Ungulina.</p>

  <p>CONCHACEA. Lam. A family of Lamarck's order Conchifera Dimyaria.
  Regular, unattached in general, closed at the sides. They are always more
  or less inequilateral. The <i>Marine</i> Conchacea are those which
  inhabit the sea. The fluviatile Conchacea are those which are found in
  rivers, ponds, &amp;c. Each of these contain various genera, which may be

  <p>CONCHIFERA. Lam. The 11th class of Invertebrata, consisting of all

  Dimyaria, which have two adductor muscles; and Monomyaria, which have but
  one.</p>

  <p>CONCHYLIOMORPHITE. A term used by De Blainville to designate the cast
  or model of a fossil shell, formed by a siliceous substance which has
  entered or surrounded it when in a liquid state, and subsequently become
  hardened into flint. The shell has afterwards decomposed or fallen off by
  accident, leaving its external or internal characters to be conjectured
  from the monumental impressions that remain.</p>

  <p>CONCHYTA. Hupsch Mus. <span class="sc">Calceola</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>CONE. A common name for shells of the genus Conus.</p>

  <p>CONE. This mathematical term is used by conchologists in its utmost
  latitude of signification to express a body, which in its formation,
  commences in a small point, called the apex, and increases in width
  towards the conclusion or base. It is applied to all shells, whether the
  increase in width be gradual or sudden; or whether in its growth, it
  takes a straight, oblique, curved, or spirally-twisted course. In this
  sense, a bivalve would be described as a pair of rapidly enlarging,
  oblique cones, and the aperture of every spiral shell would be its base.
  But this phraseology being in disuse, it is only mentioned here that it
  may be understood when occasionally met with.</p>

  <p>CONELLA. Sw. A genus composed of species of the genus Columbella, Lam.
  which have a conical form, and which, on that account, are considered by
  Swainson as belonging to his family of Coninæ. Swains. Lardner. Cyclop.
  Malac. described at p. 312. C. picata, Sw. fig. 17, a. p. 151.</p>

  <p>CONFLUENT. A term applied to two parts of a shell when they gradually
  flow into each other, as, for instance, the inner and outer lips of
  Univalves when they pass into each other at the anterior extremity,
  without the intervention of a notch or angle.</p>

  <p>CONIA. Leach. <i>Fam.</i> Balanidea. <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Four rather irregular valves, of porous
  structure, placed side by side, so as to form a circular cone, supported
  at the base on a shelly plate, and closed at the aperture by an operculum
  consisting of four valves in pairs. Distinguished from Creusia by its
  porous structure and by its flat support; that of Creusia being
  cup-shaped. Fig. 21, Conia porosa.</p>

  <p>CONICAL. A term applied in the ordinary sense, and not as explained
  above, under the word <span class="sc">Cone</span>.</p>

  <p>CONIDEA. Sw. A genus separated from Columbella, Lam. thus described,
  "Mitra shaped, fusiform; spire equal or longer than the aperture; the
  whorls tumid; outer lip slightly gibbous above, contracted below; margin
  not inflected; striated within; inner lip terminating in an elevated
  ridge, but with the teeth obsolete. C. semipunctata, (<i>Columbella</i>,
  Lam.) Mart. 44. fig. 465, 466." Africa.</p>

  <p>CONILITES. <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Lam. &amp; Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  "Conical, straight or slightly curved; having a thin external covering,
  independent of the nut or alveole, which it contains. Alveole
  transversely chambered, sub-separable." (Translated from
  Lam.)&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The difference between Belemnites and Conilites
  is that the external sheath of the latter is thin, and not filled up with
  solid matter, from the point of the alveole to the apex, as in the
  former. De Blainville places in this genus the genera Thalamulus,
  Achelois and Antimomus, Montf. two of which are figured, Knor. Sup. Fab.
  iv. fig. 1. 1. 8. 9. Conilites Pyramidatus, fig. 470.</p>

  <p>CONILITHES. Sw. A sub-genus of Coronaxis, Sw. (Coni, with coronated
  whorls) thus described, "Conic; spire considerably elevated; the aperture
  linear, C. antediluvianus, Sow. Gen. f. 1."</p>

  <p>CONOHELIX. Sw. (<i>Conus and Helix.</i>) The generic name given to
  those species of Mitra which are conical in form. Fig. 432, C.
  marmorata.</p>

  <p>CONOPLÆA. Say. <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes, Lam. A genus composed
  of Balani, attached to the stems of Gorgonia, having their bases
  elongated. <i>Ex.</i> fig. 27, Balanus Galeatus.</p>

  <p>CONORBIS. Sw. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Conus</span>, such as C. dormitor, (Sowerby, gen. fig. 8)
  which have elevated spires and the upper part of the outer lip deeply
  sinuated. Mr. Swainson considers these fossil species as analogous to the
  Pleurotomæ. <i>Sw.</i> Lard. Cyclop. Malac. p. 312.</p>

  <p>CONOVULUM. A genus proposed by Lamarck, to include the small, conical
  species of Auricula, which have the outer lip simple. This genus was
  afterwards abandoned by the author. <i>Ex.</i> fig. 298, Auricula
  coniformis.</p>

  <p>CONTIGUOUS. (<i>Contingo</i>, to touch.) A term applied to the whorls
  of spiral shells when they rest upon, or touch each other. This is the
  case in a great majority of instances. When, on the contrary, there is a
  space between the whorls, they are said to be non-contiguous, detached,
  or free. Examples of non-contiguous whorls are to be seen in Scalaria,
  fig. 351 (in this case, the distance between the whorls is small), and in
  Crioceratites, fig. 482. A "<i>Columella contiguous to the axis</i>," is
  when in the centre of the shell and takes the place of the imaginary line
  which forms its axis.</p>

  <p>CONTINUOUS. Carried on without interruption, as the siphon in Spirula,
  the varices in Ranella, fig. 394, which, occurring in a corresponding
  part of each whorl, form a continuous ridge.</p>

  <p>CONULARIA. Miller. A genus of Orthocerata, described as conical,
  straight, or nearly so, divided into chambers by imperforate septa;
  aperture half closed; apex solid, obtuse; external surface finely
  striated. Resembling Orthoceras, but wanting the siphon. Fig. 449.</p>

  <p>CONUS. Auct. (<span title="Kônos" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&omega;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a cone.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Enroulées, Lam. Angyostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Conical, convolute,
  with a short spire, consisting of numerous whorls; and narrow lengthened
  aperture, terminating in a slight emargination at each extremity; outer
  lip thin; epidermis thin; operculum small, pointed,
  horny.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This well-known genus of shells is easily
  distinguished from any other, by its conical form, its smooth columella,
  its narrow aperture, and thin outer lip. The form of the spire varies
  from flat and even partially concave, to a regular pyramidal cone; and
  the upper edges of the whorls are rounded in some species, angulated in
  others, and in some are waved or coronated. The variety of marking and
  the numerous delicate tints of these shells have caused them to be highly
  appreciated by amateur collectors; and many species, as the C. Ammiralis,
  or admiral; the C. Gloria Maris, or Glory of the Sea; the C. Cedonulli
  ("I yield to none"), and others, have always produced good prices in the
  markets. We give figures of the principal forms, as expressed in the
  genera proposed by De Montfort, of Rhombus, Hermes, Rollus and Cylinder,
  in figures 459 to 462. Many new species were brought to this country by
  Mr. Cuming, and are represented in parts 24, 25, 28, 29; 32, 33, 36, 37;
  54, 55, 56, 57; 147, 148; 151 to 158 of the Conchological Illustrations,

  The cones are mostly tropical, some are found as far north as the
  Mediterranean, and south as the Cape of Good Hope. The most beautiful
  species are from the East and West Indies.</p>

  <p>CONVOLUTE. (<i>Con</i>, together; <i>volvo</i>, to revolve). This term
  can be strictly applied only to symmetrical shells, signifying that the
  volutions are parallel to each other in a horizontal direction, as in the
  Ammonites, &amp;c.; but the term is also commonly used in describing such
  shells as Conus, in which, the direction of the whorls being scarcely
  oblique, the last whorl almost entirely covers those which precede it.
  This is the case with Lamarck's family of Enroulées. Fig. 440 to 462.</p>

  <p>CORALLIOPHAGA. Bl. <span class="sc">Cypricardia</span> Coralliophaga,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, elongated, finely striated from the apex
  to the base, cylindrical, equivalve, very inequilateral; umbones slightly
  raised and quite anterior; hinge nearly the same in both valves; two
  small cardinal teeth, one of which is bifid, placed before a kind of
  lammellated tooth, beneath a very slender external ligament; two small,
  distant, muscular impressions, united by a striated palleal impression,
  which is strongly striated posteriorly.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell,
  which is found in the empty holes of dead Lithodomi, in some instances
  conforming its shape to its situation, differs from Cypricardia of
  Lamarck, principally in its cylindrical form. C. Carditoidea, fig. 92.

  <p>CORBICULA. Megerle. <span class="sc">Cyrena</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>CORBIS. Cuv. (<i>A basket.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Nymphacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Transverse, oval, thick, ventricose, equivalve,
  sub-equilateral, free, cancellated, with denticulated internal margins;
  hinge with two cardinal and two lateral teeth in each valve; of the
  latter, one near and one remote from the umbones; muscular impressions
  lunulate, two in each valve, united by an entire palleal impression,
  without a sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus, of which only two or three
  recent species are known, resembles many species of Venus and Cytherea in
  general form; but differs in having lateral teeth, and in the palleal
  impressions which in all the Veneres, &amp;c. is sinuated. From Lucina it
  may be known, not only by its oval form, but also by the muscular
  impressions, which, in Lucina are produced into an elongated point; it
  will also be distinguished from Tellina, by the want of a posterior fold
  in the valve, for which that genus is remarkable. C. Fimbriata, fig. 101,
  is an inhabitant of the Indian Ocean. Several fossil species are found in
  the recent formations, above the chalk, at Grignon and Hauteville.</p>

  <p>CORBULA. Brug. (<i>A little basket.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Corbulacea, Lam.
  Conchacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve, sub-equilateral,
  transverse, gibbose, not gaping; cardinal tooth in each valve, conical,
  curved, prominent, inserting its extremity into a pit in the opposite
  hinge; cartilage attached to the tooth of the smaller valve, and the pit
  in the larger; muscular impressions, two in each valve, distant, rather
  irregular; palleal impression posteriorly angulated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  The shells composing this genus were placed in Mya by Linnæus, but differ
  from the true Myæ in having a sinus in the palleal impression, and a
  prominent ligamentiferous tooth in each valve, whereas the Myæ have but
  one. The Corbulæ are marine, some species inhabiting the British coasts.
  Fossil species occur abundantly in green sand, London clay, crag, and
  corresponding formations. Fig. 89. C. Nucleus.</p>

  <p>CORDIFORM. (<i>Cor</i>, a heart.) Heart-shaped, a term applied
  generally to any shell which may be fancied to resemble a heart in shape,
  as Isocardia, fig. 126, and Cardium Dionæum, fig. 122.</p>

  <p>CORIACEOUS. (<i>Corium</i>, leather.) Of the substance of leather.
  <i>Ex.</i>, the integument into which the valves of Chitones are
  inserted.</p>

  <p>CORIOCELLA. Bl. The animal designated by this name is described by De
  Blainville as being without any traces of shell, either internal or
  external. This must have arisen from the imperfection of the specimen
  described, probably deprived by accident of its shell. The testaceous
  appendage of the Coriocella is now well known to naturalists. It is a
  milky white, transparent shell, shaped like Sigaretus.</p>

  <p>CORNEA, and <span class="sc">Pisum</span>, Megerle. <span

  <p>CORNEO-CALCAREOUS. A term used to express the mixture of horny and
  shelly matter which enters into the composition of some shells, Aplysia,
  for instance. It is also applied to those Opercula, which are horny on
  one side, and testaceous on the other, as that of Turbo.</p>

  <p>CORNEUS. Horny. A species of Patella has had the specific name corneus
  given to it, because its texture more nearly resembles that of a horn
  than that of a shell. The epidermis of fresh-water shells is of a similar
  composition.</p>

  <p>CORNUCOPIA. Humph. <span class="sc">Lepas</span>, Linn.</p>

  <p>CORONALES. See <span class="sc">Coronular Multivalves</span>.</p>

  <p>CORONATED. (<i>Corona</i>, a crown.) Applied to shells when ornamented
  with a series of points, tubercles, &amp;c., round the upper edges of the
  volutions. <i>Ex.</i> Conus Nocturnus, fig. 459.</p>

  <p>CORONAXIS. One of the two genera into which Swainson divides the genus
  Conus, consisting of those species which have a row of tubercles on the
  upper edge of the whorls, an arrangement by which he would in many
  instances, not only separate between two individuals of the same species,
  but also between two parts of the same shell; for instances occur in
  which the earlier whorls are coronated, while the body whorl and the
  penultimate are perfectly plain.</p>

  <p>CORONULA. (<i>Corona</i>, a crown, dim.) <i>Order</i>, Sessile
  Cirripedes, Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Balanidea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Six
  radiated valves, joined side by side in a circle, forming a depressed
  cone; internal structure of the valves, porous or chambered; thickened at
  the base; operculum consisting of four valves in pairs; imbedded
  horizontally in a cartilaginous substance.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells
  composing this genus are found partly imbedded in the skin of whales, and
  the shells of tortoises, and are therefore destitute of the shelly
  foundation on which the Balani and other Coronular Multivalves are
  supported. C. Testudinaria, (<span class="sc">Chelonobia</span>, Leach,)
  fig. 15. C. Balænarum, (<span class="sc">Cetopirus</span>, Ranz.) fig.
  16. C. Diadema, (<span class="sc">Diadema</span>, Ranz.) fig. 17.</p>

  <p>CORONULAR MULTIVALVES are those which have their parietal valves
  joined together side by side in a circle, surrounding the body of the
  animal, so as to form a sort of coronet. This is the characteristic of
  the Sessile Cirripedes of Lamarck's system, the Balanidea of De
  Blainville.</p>

  <p>CORRODED. (<i>Corrodo</i>, eat away, consume.) The umbones, apices,
  and other thick parts of shells, are frequently worn away or consumed by
  the action of the element in which they exist. As the thickest parts of
  some shells are the most subject to this operation, it appears to the
  author to arise from the outer surface of the shell, being less under the
  influence of the animal juices than the other parts; and therefore, more
  exposed to the influence of the surrounding element. This, however, is
  not the case with respect to the Nayades and other fresh-water shells;
  with these, corrosion does not take place until after the thick epidermis
  which covers them, becomes wounded by some means or other, and then the
  animal thickens its shell within as fast as it is corroded without.</p>

  <p>CORTALUS. Montf. (Conch. Syst. 1. 115.) A genus of microscopic
  Foraminifera, placed by De Blainville in a division of the genus
  Rotalites.</p>

  <p>COWRY. A common name for shells of the genus Cypræa.</p>

  <p>CRANIA. (<i>Cranium</i>, a skull.) <i>Fam.</i> Rudistes, Lam.
  <i>Order</i>, Pallio-branchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve,
  equilateral, irregular, sub-quadrate; upper valve patelliform, conical,
  with the umbo near the centre; lower valve attached by its outer surface;
  muscular impressions, 4 in each valve; two large, posterior, distant; two
  small, near to each other, central. No hinge teeth; no
  ligament.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus properly belongs to the
  Brachiopoda, Lam. It differs from Orbicula in the mode of attachment,
  which in the latter, is by a byssus passing through the lower valve, and
  not by the valve itself. Hipponyx has only two muscular impressions in
  each valve. The name of this genus is derived from the inner surface of
  the attached valve, which presents a remarkable resemblance to the facial
  portion of a human skull. This appearance is caused by the situation and
  elevated edges of the muscular impressions. Fig. 197. Coasts of Britain
  and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>CRASSATED. (<i>Crassus</i>, thick.) Used to express a thickness in the
  substance of a shell. <i>Ex.</i> Glycimeris, fig. 67.</p>

  <p>CRASSATELLA. Lam. (<i>Crassus</i>, thick.) <i>Fam.</i> Mactracea, Lam.
  Conchacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, close,
  thick, rounded anteriorly, rostrated posteriorly, with denticulated
  margins, smooth, or ribbed transversely; hinge with a triangular pit
  containing the cartilage, two anterior cardinal teeth, and a posterior
  depression in one valve; one anterior tooth and a slight anterior
  marginal elevation, and a posterior elevation in the other valve.
  Muscular impressions distant, strongly marked. Palleal impression not
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The few recent species known are marine,
  several being brought from the coasts of New Holland. Fossil species are
  found in Calcaire-grossier and London clay. The Crassatella are known
  from the Veneres, &amp;c., by the ligamentary pit in the hinge, and from
  Lutraria and Mactra by the thickness and closeness of the shell. Fig. 84,
  C. rostrata.</p>

  <p>CRASSINA. Lam. <span class="sc">Astarte</span>, Sow.</p>

  <p>CRASSIPEDES. Lam. (<i>Crassus</i>, thick; <i>pes</i>, foot.) The first
  section of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam. In this section the foot
  of the animal is thick, and the shell gapes considerably. It is divided
  into the families Tubicolæ, Pholadidæ, Solenidæ, and Myaria. Fig. 44 to
  76.</p>

  <p>CRASSISPIRA. Sw. A genus separated from <span
  class="sc">Columbella</span>, Auct. for which Mr. Swainson quotes
  "Pleurotoma Bottæ, Auct." Crassispira fasciata, Sw. Lardn. Cyclop. Malac.

  <p>CRENATED. (<i>Crena</i>, a notch.) Applied to small notches, not
  sufficiently raised or defined, to be compared to teeth. <i>Ex.</i> The
  hinge of Iridina, fig. 150.</p>

  <p>CRENATULA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Malleacea, Lam. Margaritacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Compressed, foliated, irregular, sub-equivalve,
  inequilateral, oblique; umbones terminal; hinge linear, nearly straight,
  with a series of excavations, containing the cartilage, while the
  intervening ridges are covered with the ligament, properly so called.
  Muscular impression oblong, indistinct.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is
  known from Perna by the hinge, which in the latter is composed of a
  series of regular, straight, ligamentary grooves placed across it. In
  Crenatula also there is no passage for the byssus, as in Perna. C.
  Mytiloides, fig. 168. Coasts of the Red Sea.</p>

  <p>CRENULATED. Finely crenated or notched.</p>

  <p>CREPIDULA. Lam. (<i>Crepidula</i>, a little slipper.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Calyptracea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, irregular,
  patelliform; apex lateral, incurved, or sub-spiral; external surface
  convex, smooth, ribbed, waved, or covered with spines; interior concave,
  smooth, with a flattish septum reaching nearly half across the cavity;
  epidermis light brown.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The difference between this
  genus and Calyptræa is that in the latter, the septum is more free from
  the sides of the shell, so that, instead of forming a regular plate,
  covering half the aperture, it assumes a variety of shapes, and in some
  is cup-shaped, in others forked, and in some forms a little angular
  shelf. Indeed, the variations are so numerous that I think it would be
  better to throw the two genera into one, and then divide them into
  smaller groups. Some species of Calyptræa are farther removed from each
  other with respect to the characters of the septum and general form of
  the shell, than they are from the Crepidulæ. Fig. 239. Mediterranean,

  <p>CRESEIS. Ranz. <i>Order</i>, Pteropoda, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin,
  fragile, transparent, pyramidal, pointed; with a dorsal ridge produced
  into a point at the edge of the aperture.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The species
  found in the Mediterranean is named C. Spinifera (fig. 222), from its
  resemblance to a thorn.</p>

  <p>CREUSIA. Leach. (<i>Creux</i>, se. Fr. a cavity.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Balanidea, Bl. <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  A depressed cone, consisting of four valves, supported upon, and jointed
  to, a cup-shaped cavity formed in the Madrepores, in which it resides.
  Aperture quadrilateral, closed by an operculum of four
  valves.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from Pyrgoma, which
  is supported on the edge of a similar cup-shaped cavity, by the paries
  being composed of four valves, whereas in Pyrgoma, it consists of a
  single piece. Fig. 28, C. Gregaria. East Indies.</p>

  <p>CRICOSTOMATA. Bl. The second family of Asiphonibranchiata, Bl. It is
  thus described: "shell equally (with the animal) variable in general
  form, but of which the aperture, always nearly round, is completely
  closed by the shelly or horny operculum; whorls few, and apex
  sublateral." This family agrees in some measure with the family
  Turbinacea of Lamarck, and with the genus Turbo in the system of Linnæus.
  It contains the genera Pleurotomaria, Delphinula, Turritella, Proto,
  Scalaria, Vermetus, Siliquaria, Magilus, Valvata, Cyclostoma, and
  Paludina.</p>

  <p>CRIOCERATITES. A genus composed of species of Ammonites, with
  disconnected whorls. C. Duvallii, fig. 482.</p>

  <p>CRIOPUS. Poli. <span class="sc">Crania</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>CRISTACEA. Lam. The third family of Polythalamous Cephalopoda, Lam.
  This family is described as including shells of the following
  characters:&mdash;"Multilocular, flattened, nearly reniform; the chambers
  gradually increasing in length, as they approach the outer arched margin,
  and appearing to revolve round an eccentric, more or less marginal axis.
  The Cristacea contain the genera Renulina, Cristellaria, and
  Orbiculina."</p>

  <p>CRISTACEA. Bl. The third family of Polythalamia, Bl. containing the
  genera Crepidulina, (Cristellaria, Lam.) Oreas and Linthuris.</p>

  class="sc">Testacellus</span> Ambiguus of Ferrusac. Published in
  Sowerby's Genera of Shells as <span class="sc">Parmacella</span>
  calyculata.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> A small patelliform shell, with a very
  short papillary spire; and the aperture irregularly expanded. Fig. 256.
  Canary Islands.</p>

  <p>CRYPTOCONCHUS. Bl. A genus composed of species of Chiton, the valves
  of which are covered by the integument, as Chiton porosus of Burrows. Ch.
  amiculatus of Pallas.</p>

  <p>CRYPTODIBRANCHIATA. Bl. The first order of the class Cephalophora, Bl.
  containing families of molluscous animals destitute of shells.</p>

  <p>CRYPTOSTOMA. Bl. Differs from <span class="sc">Sigaretus</span>, Lam.
  principally in the soft parts of the animal. De Blainville remarks that
  he is acquainted with only two species (from the Indies), which he can
  with decision refer to the genus, but he thinks that many of the
  Lamarckian Sigareti may very probably be found to belong to it, as soon
  as the soft parts shall be known. The species which he figures is
  Cryptostoma Leachii. (Manuel de Malacologie, pl. 42. fig. 3.)</p>

  <p>CTENOCONCHA. Gray. Described as having many characters in common with
  the Solens, the teeth like Nucula, but the cartilage entirely external.
  <span class="sc">Solenella</span>, Sow.?</p>

  <p>CUCULLÆA. Lam. (<i>Cucullus</i>, a hood.) <i>Fam.</i> Arcacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-quadrate, nearly equivalve, sub-equilateral,
  deep; hinge rectilinear, with a series of angular teeth, small near the
  umbones, larger and more oblique towards the extremities; umbones
  separated by a flat external area, on which the ligament is spread.
  Anterior muscular impression produced into a sharp-edged plate or ledge,
  projecting from the side of the shell. Posterior muscular impression flat
  and indistinct.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus very much resembles Arca in
  general form, but differs in the oblique, lengthened character of the
  remote teeth, and in the singularly prominent edge of the muscular
  impression. China. Fig. 133, C. Auriculifera.</p>

  <p>CUMINGIA. Sow. <i>Fam.</i> Mactracea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, rounded anteriorly, subrostrated
  posteriorly. Hinge with a central spoon-shaped cavity in each valve,
  containing the cartilage; a very small anterior cardinal tooth in each
  valve; two lateral teeth in one valve, none in the other: muscular
  impressions two in each valve, distant; palleal impression with a very
  large posterior sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The species known at present are
  found in sand, in the fissures of rocks in Tropical climates. They
  resemble Erycina in general form and character, but differ in having the
  internal cartilage placed in a prominent spoon-shaped process, while that
  of Erycina is contained in a hollow which sinks under the umbones. This
  genus should be placed near Amphidesma. Cumingia mutica, fig. 87.</p>

  <p>CUNEIFORM. (<i>Cuneus</i>, a wedge.) Wedge-shaped, as Donax, fig.
  108.</p>

  <p>CUNEUS. Megerle. <span class="sc">Venus</span> Meroe, Linn. and

  <p>CUNICULA. Sw. A sub-genus of Uniones, thus described:&mdash;"Ovate,
  oblong; bosses thick, but depressed; cardinal teeth moderate. C.
  planulata, patula, rubiginosa, secura, purpurascens."</p>

  <p>CURVED. Arched or bent. <i>Ex.</i> Dentalium, fig. 2.</p>

  <p>CURVULA. Rafinesque. A fossil imperfectly described as differing from
  Pinna, in being inequivalve.</p>

  <p>CUVIERIA. Ranz. (Baron Cuvier.) <i>Class</i>, Pteropoda,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, transparent, glassy, cylindrical, rounded
  and inflated at the closed extremity, compressed towards the opening, so
  as to render it oval. This genus differs from Vaginula in being rounded,
  instead of pointed, at the lower extremity. Mediterranean. Fig. 223, C.
  Columella.</p>

  <p>CYCLAS. Brug. <i>Fam.</i> Conques Fluviatiles, Lam. Conchacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Orbicular, thin, subovate, ventricose,
  sub-equilateral, equivalve; cardinal teeth minute, one more or less
  complicated in the left valve, two diverging in the right; lateral teeth
  elongated, compressed, laminar, acute, doubled in the left valve;
  ligament external; epidermis thin, horny.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Cyclades
  are viviparous, and abound in ditches, ponds, slow streams, &amp;c. in
  Europe and North America. The genus Pisidium has been separated on
  account of a difference in the animal, and may be known from Cyclas by
  being less equilateral, and the anterior side being the longest. Fig.
  111, C. Rivicola.</p>

  <p>CYCLOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The third order of the second section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica, Bl. containing no genera of Testaceous
  Mollusca.</p>

  <p>CYCLOCANTHA. Sw. A genus of "Trochidæ," consisting of Turbo stellaris
  and T. Calcar, and corresponding with the genus Calcar, Montf.</p>

  <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam. Cricostomata, Bl. A genus of land shells
  varying in shape from that of Pupa to that of a flat orb; the aperture is
  generally circular and the peritreme uninterrupted, thickened and
  sometimes reflected, the operculum is shelly and spiral. Two other genera
  of land shells are provided with opercula, and consequently might be
  confounded with this genus. In Helicina, the operculum is concentric and
  the peritreme is not continuous; while in the small genus hitherto almost
  unknown of Pupina, the peritreme is not continuous and there is a glassy
  enamel over the whole of the external surface. In the plates we have
  represented, C. ferrugineum, fig. 303; C. involvulus, fig. 304.</p>

  are nearly parallel, with the extremities either rounded, flat, or
  conical. <i>Ex.</i> Oliva, fig. 457.</p>

  <p>CYLLENE. Gray. <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval,
  thick, with a short acute spire; an oval aperture terminating anteriorly
  in a slight emargination, posteriorly in a short canal; a fold at the
  lower end of the body whorl; outer lip thick, striated within; angle of
  the whorls tuberculated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of small marine
  shells resembles Voluta in general character, but differs in having a
  smooth columella without folds. Recent, Pacific Ocean; Fosil, London
  clay. Fig. 425.</p>

  <p>CYMBA. Brod. (<i>Cymba</i>, a boat or skiff.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Columellaria, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Smooth, ventricose, with a very
  short, mammillated, rude spire; and a very large, wide aperture,
  terminated anteriorly in a deep emargination; posteriorly in a flat
  ledge, which separates the outer lip from the body whorl; columella with
  three or four oblique, laminar, projecting folds, terminating in a point;
  outer lip thin, with its edge sharp; epidermis smooth, brown, covered
  partly or entirely by the glassy enamel, which, commencing with the outer
  lip, spreads over the body of the shell.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> These very
  elegant shells, found in Africa, are distinguished from the true Volutes
  by the shapeless, mammillated apex of the short spire, by the large size
  of the aperture, and by the horizontal ledge which separates the outer
  lip from the body whorl. The genus Melo, also separated by Mr. Broderip
  from the Volutes, agrees with Cymba in some respects, but differs in the
  regularity of the spire. Fig. 434, C. Porcina.</p>

  <p>CYMBIOLA. Sw. The generic name for a group of Volutes, described as
  "armed with spinous tubercules, sometimes smooth, but never ribbed;
  spiral whorls gradually diminishing in size, but not distorted; apex
  thick and obtuse; pillar with four plaits." Mr. Swainson remarks that
  this genus is chiefly distinguished by the obtuse, but not irregular
  spire. The typical species are stated to be V. Rutila and V. Vespertilio,
  fig. 433. Tropical.</p>

  <p>CYMBULIA. (Dim. from <i>Cymba</i>.) <i>Fam.</i> Pteropoda, Lam. An
  extremely light, cartilaginous covering of a molluscous animal, so named
  from its similarity in shape to a boat. We mention it here on account of
  its similarity to the shelly or glassy covering of other Pteropods, to
  which, although membranaceous, it is evidently analogous. The Cymbuliæ
  are found in the Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>CYPRÆA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Enroulées, Lam. Angyostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval or oblong, ventricose, convolute, covered by
  an enamel, generally smooth and shining. Spire short, nearly hid.
  Aperture long, narrow, terminating in a short canal at both extremities.
  Outer lip dentated, thickened, inflected. Inner lip dentated, thickened,
  reflected over part of the body whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> These shells are
  so distinguished by the two rows of teeth arranged on each side of the
  aperture; the thickened front formed by the inner and outer lips; and the
  enamel deposited over the back of the shell from the mantle of the animal
  which envelopes it, that there is no danger of confounding them with any
  other genus, except in a young state. Before they have arrived at the
  full growth, the front is not thickened, and the outer lip is thin, not
  inflected, nor are the teeth formed. In this state the shell resembles,
  in some degree, an Oliva. Some species are striated, ribbed, or
  tuberculated, but the generality are smooth. Most species belong to
  tropical climates, only one to Great Britain. The C. Moneta is current as
  money in some parts of Africa, and many species are worn as ornaments by
  the South Sea Islanders. The colouring in most species is exceedingly
  rich, and arranged in every variety of spots, patches, rings, lines,
  bands and clouds. The species most esteemed by collectors are C. Mappa,
  C. Testudinaria, C. Pustulata, C. Aurora, C. Princeps, of which only two
  specimens are known, C. Leucodon, &amp;c. See also Cypræovulum, Trivea
  and Luponia. The fossil species are principally from the Calc-grossier,
  the London Clay, Crag, &amp;c. Fig. 445 to 450. The latest revision of
  this genus has been effected by Mr. G. B. Sowerby, sen., who has
  published a complete catalogue in his son's Conchological Illustrations.
  This catalogue enumerates 130 species, the whole of which are figured in
  parts 1 to 8, 101 to 131 of the above mentioned work.</p>

  <p>CYPRÆCASSIS. Stutch. (Cypræa and Cassis.)&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Shell,
  when young, striated, reticulated, or tuberculated; outer lip simple:
  when mature, outer lip involute and toothed; columellar lip also toothed;
  aperture straight, anteriorly terminated by a recurved canal, posteriorly
  by a shallow channel. Animal with the mantle bilobed; operculum
  none.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The reasons given for separating this genus from
  Cassis, are, 1st, That the shells of the latter have an operculum, while
  those of the proposed genus have none. 2nd, That the Cypræcassides do not
  form a complete, thickened lip, before the full period of their growth,
  like the Cassides. 3rd, That the Cypræcassides have no epidermis. The
  species mentioned as probably belonging to Cypræcassis are C. rufa, the
  type; C. coarctata, and C. Testiculus, Auct. The establishment of this
  genus has been opposed on the ground that indications of epidermis are
  discoverable in some specimens of C. rufa; that some specimens of the
  same species and Testiculus have been examined, and found to have formed
  slightly thickened and dentulated outer lips at very early periods of
  growth, while many of the other Cassides are destitute of varices, and
  that an operculum of C. coarctata was brought to this country by Mr.
  Cuming. It is probable, however, that an increased knowledge of facts
  might go far to establish the separation. C. Testiculus, fig. 412.</p>

  <p>CYPRÆADIA. Sw. A genus of the family "Cypræidæ," Sw. thus
  described:&mdash;"Cypræform; the base contracted; the body whorl not
  flattened beneath; shell cancellated; aperture of equal breadth
  throughout; a few thickened, short teeth on the pillar; lip at the base,
  which is not internally concave. C. cancellata, Sw. Fossil only,
  differing from Trivea in its contracted base, in the inequality of its
  aperture, and the equal convexity of the inner lip within." (Sw. Lardn.
  Cyclop. Malac. p. 325.) Cyprædia, fig. 564.</p>

  <p>CYPRÆLA. Sw. A genus formed for the reception of Ovulum verrucosum,
  Auct. which has a circular depression at each extremity. It is the same
  as the genus Calpurnus of De Montfort. Ovulum verrucosum, fig. 441.</p>

  <p>CYPRÆOVULUM. Gray. A genus of Cypræidæ thus described, "shell like a
  cowry, but front end of columella covered with regular cross-ribs, like
  the rest of the base, internally produced into an acute toothed ridge.
  Shell pear-shaped, cross-ridged." C. capense, fig. 444. South Africa.</p>

  <p>CYPRICARDIA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Cardiacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, inequilateral, subquadrate, transversely elongated, with the
  anterior side very short; hinge with three cardinal teeth and one remote
  lateral tooth in each valve; muscular impressions two in each valve;
  ligament external.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from
  Cardita by the three cardinal teeth. The mollusca of this genus are
  marine. C. angulata, fig. 125. Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>CYPRINA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> "Conques Marines," or Marine
  Conchacea.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, sub-orbicular;
  umbones curved obliquely; hinge with three diverging cardinal and one
  remote lateral teeth in each valve; ligament external; muscular
  impressions two in each valve; palleal impression having a slight
  posterior sinus; epidermis thick, rough brown.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  Cyprinæ belong to the Northern hemisphere. The recent species are not
  numerous. Fossil species are found in the tertiary deposits. Cyprina may
  be known from Venus by the remote lateral tooth and the thick epidermis.
  C. vulgaris, fig. 116.</p>

  <p>CYRENA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Fluviatile Conchaceæ, Lam. Conchacea,
  Bl&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Suborbicular, equivalve, inequilateral,
  ventricose, corroded at the umbones, thick, covered with a thick
  epidermis; hinge with three cardinal and two remote lateral teeth in each
  valve. Muscular impressions two in each valve; palleal impression not
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from Venus,
  Cytherea and Cyprina, by having two remote lateral teeth; and from Cyclas
  by the thickness of the shell. This genus is mostly fluviatile; the
  recent species are tropical, and the fossil are found in the newest
  formations. Fig. 113, C. fuscata.</p>

  <p>CYRENELLA. Desh. See <span class="sc">Cyrenoides</span>.</p>

  <p>CYRENOIDES. Joannis. <span class="sc">Cyrenella</span>, Desh.
  <i>Fam.</i> Conques Fluviatiles, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve,
  subequilateral, ventricose, thin, covered with a reddish brown epidermis,
  corroded at the umbones, with a slight posterior fold. Hinge thin, with
  three diverging cardinal teeth in each valve, and a very slight posterior
  fold in the right valve. Ligament not very tumid.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This
  fresh-water shell differs from Cyclas and Cyrena in the want of lateral
  teeth, and from the latter in the thinness of the shell. Fig. 114.</p>

  <p>CYRTIA. Dalman. (<span title="Kurtos" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&upsilon;&rho;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, curtos, gibbose.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> "Hinge rectilinear;
  with the back elevated into a semicone or half-pyramid, the cardinal side
  perpendicularly <i>plane</i>."&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of fossil
  Brachiopoda forms part of the genus Spirifer, Sow. C. exporrecta,
  (Anomites exporrecta, Nonnull.) fig. 204.</p>

  <p>CYTHEREA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> "Conques Marines," Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, inæquilateral, oval, lenticular, or sub-trigonal; hinge with
  two or more short, diverging cardinal teeth, and one anterior approximate
  lateral tooth in each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Cythereæ are
  distinguished from the Veneres by the lateral tooth. C. Meretrix, fig.
  117, and 117, <i>a. b. c. d.</i></p>

  <p>DACTYLUS. Humph. <span class="sc">Marginella</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>DARACIA. Gray. A subgenus of Pyrgoma, including a species which is
  remarkable for the irregularity of its form. It grows upon a species of
  Monticularia, and the margin takes the shape of the lobes by which it is
  surrounded. The aperture is large, and completely closed by the
  operculum. Daracia (Pyrgoma) Monticulariæ, fig. 489, 490.</p>

  <p>DATE. A common name given to shells of the genus Pholas, on account of
  their cylindrical form and consequent resemblance to the fruit. For the
  same reason the name Pholas Dactylus has been given by Naturalists to the
  species which we represent, fig. 66.</p>

  <p>DEAD SHELL. A term used among collectors to signify that the shell has
  been exposed on the sea-shore after the animal has ceased to live. A
  shell in this condition is worn down by attrition, and loses its beauty
  and brilliancy of colouring by being subject to the action of salt water.
  A dead shell may be known by a certain hoary whiteness spread over its
  surface.</p>

  <p>DECACERA. Bl. The second family of the order Cryptodibranchiata, Bl.
  containing the genera Calmar and Sepia, which have no shells.</p>

  <p>DECADOPECTEN. Rüppell. <span class="sc">Pecten</span> <i>Plica</i>,
  Linn. Fig. 172, having a plicated hinge.</p>

  <p>DECOLLATED. (<i>Decollari</i>, to be beheaded.) The apex or nucleus of
  some shells being composed of a more fragile substance than the rest, has
  a tendency to fall off. The reason of this probably is that the animal
  withdrawing from that part, leaves it unprotected. When it falls off, the
  hole is stopped up by a septum filling the cavity of the volution, so as
  to exclude the air: the shell is then said to be decollated. <i>Ex.</i>
  Bulinus decollatus, fig. 289.</p>

  <p>DECUSSATED. Intersected by striæ crossing each other. <i>Ex.</i>
  Rissoa, fig. 346.</p>

  <p>DELPHINULA. Montf. (<i>Delphinus</i>, a dolphin.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Scalariens, Lam. Cricostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Orbicular,
  depressed, thick, rugose; whorls few, angulated, branched at the angles;
  aperture pearly, rounded or sub-quadrate; peritreme continuous,
  thickened; operculum horny, composed of numerous
  whorls.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Several fossil species are found in the
  tertiary deposits. D. laciniata, fig. 352. Recent species belong to
  tropical climates.</p>

  <p>DELTHYRIS. Dalman. <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Hinge more or less rounded, with distant umbones; both valves convex;
  with the umbo of the largest rostrated and deltoid, with a hollow. This
  genus forms part of the genus Spirifer, Sow. Fig. 205. D. Plycotes,
  Dalman.</p>

  <p>DELTOID. (<span title="D" class="grk">&Delta;</span>, <i>delta</i>.)
  Triangular.</p>

  <p>DENDOSTREA. Sw. (<span title="Dendron" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&epsilon;&nu;&delta;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>dendron</i>,
  tree; <span title="ostreon" class="grk"
  >&omicron;&sigma;&tau;&rho;&epsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>ostreon</i>,
  oyster.) Ostrea <i>Crista-galli</i>, and other species which are attached
  to stems of sea-weed and corallines, by means of arms thrown out from the
  inner surface of the lower valve. Fig. 181, Ostrea Folium.</p>

  <p>DENTALIUM. Auct. (<i>Dens</i>, a tooth.) <i>Fam.</i> Maldania, Lam.
  <i>Order</i>, Cirrobranchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Tubular, arched,
  increasing in size towards the anterior extremity, open at both ends;
  small aperture sometimes having a lateral fissure; large aperture round;
  external surface ribbed, striated or smooth.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The well
  known shells composing this genus are shaped very much like an elephant's
  tusk, and are not liable to be confounded with any other genus. The
  fossil species are sometimes termed Dentalithes, from <i>dens</i>, a
  tooth, and <i>lithos</i>, a stone. The Dentalia, being true molluscs, are
  not rightly placed among the Annelides. Fig. 2, D. octogonum. Found on
  sandy shores in most climates.</p>

  <p>DENTATED. Having teeth or raised points.</p>

  <p>DENTICULATED. (Denticulatus, Lat.) Having little teeth or raised
  points.</p>

  <p>DEPRESSED. Flattened, pressed down, as the spires of some shells.</p>

  <p>DEXTRAL Spiral Shells. Place the point of a spiral shell towards the
  eye, with its mouth downwards; if, as in most instances, the aperture be
  on the right side of the axis, it is a <i>dextral</i> shell, if
  otherwise, it is <i>sinistral</i> or <i>reversed</i>. Balea (fig. 296),
  and Clausilia (fig. 295), are examples of reversed shells.</p>

  <p>DEXTRAL Valve. Take a bivalve shell closed, place it before the eye,
  with the umbones uppermost, and the posterior side, which may be known by
  the ligament towards the observer, whose right side will then correspond
  with the right valve of the shell.</p>

  <p>DIADEMA. Ranz. <span class="sc">Coronula</span> Diadema, Auct. fig.
  17.</p>

  <p>DIANCHORA. Sow. <i>Fam.</i> Pectinides, Lam. <i>Order</i>,
  Palliobranchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve, attached, oblique,
  subtriangular; attached valve, having an opening in the place of the
  umbo; the other valve auriculated, with an obtuse umbo; hinge without
  teeth.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The green sand fossils contained in this genus
  differ from Plagiostoma in being attached. Fig. 175, D. striata.</p>

  <p>DIAPHANOUS. (<span title="Dia" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&alpha;</span>, <i>dia</i>, through; <span title="phainô" class="grk"
  >&phi;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omega;</span>, <i>phaino</i>, to shine.)
  Transparent.</p>

  <p>DIAPHRAGM, (<span title="diaphragma" class="grk"
  >&delta;&iota;&alpha;&phi;&rho;&alpha;&gamma;&mu;&alpha;</span>, a
  partition.) This term is applied to the septa, by which the chambers of
  multilocular and other shells are divided from each other.</p>

  <p>DICERAS. Lam. (<span title="Dis" class="grk"
  >&Delta;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>dis</i>, double; <span title="Keras" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&epsilon;&rho;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>ceras</i>, horn.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Chamacea, Bl. and Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequilateral,
  inequivalve, attached by the point of the umbo of the larger valve;
  umbones prominent, spirally twisted and grooved; hinge with one large
  thick tooth in the larger valve; muscular impressions, two in each
  valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The prominent spiral umbones, which give rise to
  the name of this genus, with the circumstance of its being attached by
  the point of one of them, is sufficient to distinguish it from any other,
  although it appears to approach Isocardia in some characters. In others
  it will be found still more nearly to resemble Chama. In fact, from being
  attached and irregular, the shells composing this genus have been
  considered as Chamæ with produced umbones. The singular fossil shells
  composing this genus, are found in granular limestone, near Geneva and in
  Normandy. Fig. 154, D. perversum.</p>

  <p>DIDONTA. Schum. <span class="sc">Saxicava.</span> Auct.</p>

  <p>DIFFUSE. (<i>Diffundo</i>, to spread out, to dilate.) A term applied
  to the aperture of a univalve shell, when it is spread out or widened
  into a flat surface, or digitations. <i>Alated</i> is another term used
  to express the same character. Thus, the shells belonging to the family
  of Alatæ, in the system of Lamarck, are <i>diffuse</i> in the outer lip.
  Fig. 402 to 406.</p>

  <p>DIGITATED. (<i>Digitus</i>, finger.) Branched out in long points, as
  Ricinula, fig. 413.</p>

  <p>DILATED. Expanded, spread. This term has the same application as
  diffuse and alated, explained above. The outer lip of Rostellaria
  Columbaria, fig. 403 (Hippochrenes, Montf.), will serve as an
  example.</p>

  <p>DIMORPHINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>DIMYARIA. (<span title="Dis" class="grk">&Delta;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>dis</i>, double; <span title="muon" class="grk"
  >&mu;&upsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>myon</i>, muscle.) The first order
  of Conchifera, Lam. including those molluscs which have two adductor
  muscles, and consequently two muscular impressions in each valve. The
  Conchifera Dimyaria are divided into Crassipedes, Tenuipedes,
  Lamellipedes, and Ambiguæ, fig. 44 to 155.</p>

  <p>DIOICA. Bl. The first division of the class Paracephalophora, Bl. It
  is divided into the orders Siphonobranchiata and Asiphonibranchiata,
  Bl.</p>

  <p>DIPLODON. Spix. <span class="sc">Hyria</span> Syrmatophora, Lam. fig.
  144, and <span class="sc">Unio</span> multistriatus, Lea, are doubtfully
  quoted by Lea as belonging to this apparently ill-defined genus of
  Nayades.</p>

  <p>DIPSAS. Leach. A genus or sub-genus of Nayades, the distinctive
  character of which is "having a linear tooth under the dorsal edge." D.
  plicatus, fig. 142.</p>

  <p>DISCINA. Lam. <span class="sc">Orbicula</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>DISCODOMA. Sw. A sub-genus of Lucerninæ, Sw. (Helix), thus described,
  "teeth none; aperture angulated; the inner lip nearly obsolete; the outer
  only slightly thickened; margin carinated."</p>

  <p>DISCOIDAL. (<i>Discus</i>, a circular plane.) A spiral shell is said
  to be discoidal, when the whorls are so horizontally convolute as to form
  a flattened spire. <i>Ex.</i> Planorbis, fig. 311. Orbulites Discus, fig.
  479.</p>

  <p>DISCOLITES. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>DISCONTINUOUS. Interrupted. <i>Ex.</i> The siphon of Nautilus is
  discontinuous, i. e. its termination in one chamber does not reach to its
  commencement in the next. The varices of Triton, occurring in different
  parts of the whorls, do not form the continuous ridges which characterize
  the generality of the Ranellæ.</p>

  <p>DISCORBITES. Lam. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>DISTANT. The teeth on the hinge of a bivalve shell are said to be
  distant when they are remote from the umbones.</p>

  <p>DIVARICATED. Diverging, meeting in a point, as the teeth on the hinge
  of Placuna, fig. 184.</p>

  <p>DOLABELLA. Lam. (Dim. from <i>Dolabra</i>, a hatchet.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Aplysiacea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Hatchet-shaped, arched,
  covered with a horny epidermis; posteriorly attenuated, thickened,
  sub-spiral, anteriorly plane, broad, thin; posterior margin
  reflected.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The two or three species of Dolabella known
  are inhabitants of the Indian Ocean. They were placed by Linnæus in his
  very convenient genus Bulla, under the name B. dubia. Fig. 255, Dolabella
  Rumphii.</p>

  <p>DOLIUM. D'Argenville. (<i>a tun.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.
  Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, ventricose, oval, or
  globular, with a short spire; large aperture terminating in a reflected
  canal, and spirally ribbed or grooved external surface; outer lip
  crenated; inner lip reflected over part of the body whorl, which
  terminates in a tumid varix; epidermis light, horny. Mediterranean and
  East Indian.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from Cassis by
  the outer lip, which is not reflected. The species which are not so
  rotund as the others, as D. Perdix, Auct. have been separated under the
  name Perdix, as generic. Fig. 420, Dolium Maculatum.</p>

  <p>DONAX. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Nymphacea, Lam. Conchacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, trigonal, with the
  anterior side short, straight, plane; the posterior side elongated, drawn
  to a narrow, rounded termination; hinge with two cardinal teeth in one
  valve, one in the other, and one or two, more or less remote lateral
  teeth; ligament external; muscular impressions two in each valve; palleal
  impression sinuated posteriorly.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Capsæ have not the
  crenated margins, the short anterior side, and the distinct lateral
  teeth, which characterize the Donaces. Some species of Erycina resemble
  Donax in general form, but are at once distinguished by the ligamentary
  pit in the hinge. Sandy shores in all climates. Fig. 108, D.
  cuneatus.</p>

  <p>DORSAL. A dorsal shell is one placed upon the back of the animal. The
  dorsal margin of a bivalve shell is that on which the hinge is placed;
  the opposite margins are termed ventral. The dorsal surface of a spiral
  univalve is that which is seen when the aperture is turned from the
  observer. The dorsal valve is the uppermost in Brachiopodous bivalves.
  The dorsal part of a symmetrical convolute univalve, such as the Nautilus
  and Ammonite is that part of the whorls which is at the greatest distance
  from the spire, that is, the outer part of the whorls. Thus the situation
  of the siphon is said to be dorsal when it pierces the septum near the
  outer edge of the whorls. The dorsal part of symmetrical conical
  univalves, such as Patella, is the upper part, on which the apex is
  placed.</p>

  <p>DORSALIA. Lam. (<i>Dorsum</i>, the back.) The first family of the
  order Annelides Sedentaria, Lam. containing the genera Arenicola, not a
  shell, and Siliquaria, fig. 1, which is now considered as a true mollusc,
  and placed next to Vermetus.</p>

  <p>DOSINA. Schum. <span class="sc">Venus</span> Verrucosa, Casina, and
  similar species. Fig. 119, <i>a</i>.</p>

  <p>DREISSINA. <span class="sc">Mytilus</span> Polymorphus. Auct. fig.
  159. This genus differs from Mytilus principally in the characters of the
  animal. The shell is characterized by a small septiform plate under the
  hinge within. Fluviatile, Europe and Africa.</p>

  <p>EBURNA. Lam. (<i>Eburneus</i>, ivory.) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.
  Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, thick, smooth, turrited,
  umbilicated; spire angulated, acute, nearly as long as the aperture;
  aperture oval, terminating anteriorly in a canal, posteriorly in a
  groove; outer lip slightly thickened with an anterior notch, which
  terminates in a spiral fold surrounding the body whorl; umbilicus
  generally covered by the thickened columellar lip.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  beautiful shells called ivory shells, which originally constituted part
  of this genus, are now placed in the genus Ancillaria by authors. They
  differ from the present genus Eburna, in having the sutures of the spire
  covered with a polished enamel. (A. glabrata, fig. 455.) The Eburnæ
  resemble in some respects the genus Buccinum, but a glance at the figure
  will enable the reader to distinguish a true Eburna from all other
  shells. Fig. 426 is Eburna Zeylanica. A catalogue of 9 species is given
  in part 20 of the Conchological Illustrations published by the Author,
  accompanied by figures of several species.</p>

  <p>ECHIDNIS. Montf. Described as a straight, chambered, annulated, fossil
  shell, computed from the extremely gradual increase in diameter of the
  fragments to be at least sixteen feet long. Found in marble from the
  Pyrenees.</p>

  <p>ECHINELLA. Sw. A sub-genus of Monodonta. Sw. Malac. page 352.</p>

  <p>EFFUSE. (<i>effundo</i>, to pour out.) The aperture of an univalve
  shell is said to be effuse when there is a notch in the margin which
  would suffer a liquid to escape, and thus prevent it being filled to the
  brim.</p>

  <p>EGEON. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>EGERIA. Lea. (Contrib. to Geol. p. 49, pl. 1.) A genus of fossil
  bivalves, described as very variable in form, with or without lateral
  teeth, sometimes a crenated margin, &amp;c. The only certain characters
  appear to be that they have two diverging cardinal teeth in each valve,
  one of which is bifid; and an external ligament. Lea states that the
  Egeriæ should be placed between the Sanguinolariæ and the Psammobiæ,
  which two latter genera have been united by Sowerby. Fig. 103, E.
  Triangulata, from the tertiary formation of Alabama.</p>

  <p>ELENCHUS. Humph. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Trochus</span>
  Iris, Auct. and other similarly formed species. It is the same as <span
  class="sc">Cantharidus</span> of Montfort.</p>

  <p>ELEPHANT'S TUSK. The common name given by dealers to shells of the
  genus Dentalium. <i>Ex.</i> D. octogonum, fig. 2.</p>

  <p>ELEVATED. A term which is applied by some conchological writers to the
  spire of an univalve shell when it consists of numerous whorls drawn out
  into a telescopic form. Other authors use the term <i>elongated</i>, or
  the more simple one '<i>long</i>,' to express the degree of
  elevation.</p>

  <p>ELISMA. Leach. A sub-genus of Bulinus. B. acutus, Auct. Gray, Turton,
  p. 185.</p>

  <p>ELLIPSOLITHES. Montf. (<span title="Elleipsis" class="grk"
  >&Epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>ellipsis</i>, oval; <span title="lithos," class="grk"
  >&lambda;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;,</span> <i>lithos</i>, stone.) A
  genus composed of Ammonites, which instead of being regularly orbicular,
  take an elliptical or oval form. This character appears to be accidental,
  as some individuals of the same species, both of Nautilus and Ammonites,
  are round, while others are compressed into an oval form.</p>

  <p>ELLIPSOSTOMATA. Bl. (<span title="Elleipsis" class="grk"
  >&Epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>ellipsis</i>, oval; <span title="stôma" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&omega;&mu;&alpha;</span>, <i>mouth</i>.) The third family
  of the class Asiphonibranchiata, Bl. The shells of this family are
  described as of various forms, generally smooth; the aperture
  longitudinally or transversely oval, completely closed by a horny or
  shelly operculum. This family contains the genera Rissoa, Phasianella,
  Ampullaria, Helicina, and Pleuroceras.</p>

  <p>ELLIPTICAL. (<span title="Elleipsis" class="grk"
  >&Epsilon;&lambda;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&psi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>ellipsis</i>.) Oval. Applied to any shell or part of a shell, having
  that form.</p>

  <p>ELMINEUS. Leach. <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Four unequal valves, arranged circularly side by
  side, forming a quadrate cone; aperture large, sub-quadrate, irregular;
  operculum composed of four valves, in pairs.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus
  differs from Conia in the structure of the shell, the latter being
  porous. Fig. 22, Elmineus Leachii.</p>

  <p>ELPHIDIUM. Montf. (Conch. Syst. t. 1. p. 15.) A genus of microscopic
  Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>EMARGINATED. (<i>e</i>, out; <i>margo</i>, border.) Notched or
  hollowed out. Applied to the edges or margins of shells, when instead of
  being level they are hollowed out, as the outer lip of Oliva, fig. 457,
  at the base, and the ventral margins of some bivalves.</p>

  <p>EMARGINULA. Lam. (<i>e</i>, out; <i>margo</i>, border.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Calyptracea, Lam. Branchifera, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Patelliform,
  oblong or oval; anterior margin notched or emarginated; apex posteriorly
  inclined; muscular impressions wide.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Emarginula
  elongata, of some Authors, <span class="sc">Parmophorus</span> of De
  Blainville is commonly called the Duck's bill limpet, from its shape. The
  Emarginulæ may be known from Patellæ and other neighbouring genera, by
  the notch or slit in the anterior edge. In the genus Rimula, Defr. fig.
  243, this slit is near the apex, and does not reach the margin. Recent
  species occur in all climates, but are not numerous. Fossil species are
  still more rare, occurring in the Calc-grossièr, Crag and Oolite. E.
  fissurata, fig. 241.</p>

  <p>ENA. Leach. A sub-genus of Bulinus. B. Lackhamensis. Mont.</p>

  <p>ENDOSIPHONITES. A genus composed of Ammonites, having the siphon close
  to the body whorl, fig. 476.</p>

  <p>ENDOTOMA. Rafinesque. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>ENROULEES. Lam. See <span class="sc">Convolutæ</span>.</p>

  <p>ENSATELLA. Sw. A genus consisting of <span class="sc">Solen</span>
  ensis, Auct. fig. 60, and other species similarly curved. <i>Genus</i>
  <span class="sc">Ensis</span>, Schum.</p>

  <p>ENSIS. Schum. <span class="sc">Solen</span> ensis, Auct. and similar
  species.</p>

  <p>ENTALIS. Defr. <span class="sc">Dentalium</span> duplicatum, Bl. <span
  class="sc">Pharetrium</span>, König. This genus is described as a small
  tube, within a larger one, the smaller extremity of the inner tube
  projecting beyond that of the outer one. Deshayes, who describes this
  genus, expresses a conviction that the soft parts of the animal must be
  entirely different from those of the animal of Dentalium. The genus <span
  class="sc">Pharetrium</span>, as described by König in his "Icones
  Fossilium Sectiles," is evidently identical with Entalis. It is placed by
  him in the family of Pteropoda, but being a fossil shell, there is some
  difficulty in finding its place in the system. See plates, fig. 3.</p>

  <p>ENTELLITES. Fischer. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Terebratula</span>, <span class="sc">Spirifer</span>, and
  <span class="sc">Productus</span>, Auct. having the hinge large and the
  umbones short. <span class="sc">Orthis?</span> Dalman.</p>

  <p>ENTIRE. (Integra.) Not interrupted, not emarginated. The peritrême of
  a univalve shell is said to be entire when not interrupted by canals or
  by the body whorl. <i>Ex.</i> Cyclostoma, fig. 304. The palleal
  impression is entire, when continued without interruption, or without a
  sinus.</p>

  <p>ENTOMOSTOMATA. Bl. The second family of the order Siphonibranchiata,
  Bl. The shells of this family are described as differing but little from
  those contained in the family of Siphonostomata of the same author, both
  with regard to the soft parts, and their testaceous covering. This family
  partly answers to the Purpuriferæ in the system of Lamarck, and contains
  the genera Subula, Cerithium, Melanopsis, Planaxis, Terebra, Eburna,
  Buccinum, Harpa, Dolium, Cassidaria, Cassis, Ricinula, Cancellaria,
  Purpura, Concholepas.</p>

  <p>EOLIDES. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>EPIDERMIS. (<span title="Epi" class="grk">&Epsilon;&pi;&iota;</span>,
  <i>epi</i>, over or upon; <span title="derma" class="grk"
  >&delta;&epsilon;&rho;&mu;&alpha;</span>, <i>derma</i>, skin.) The
  fibrous, horny, external coating of shells, called by the French,
  "<i>Drap marin</i>," or marine cloth. Lamarck objects to the name
  Epidermis because he does not consider the substance as answering to the
  cuticle or scarf skin of the human body, but more analogous to the nails
  and hair. Gray calls it the <span class="sc">Periostracum</span>, from
  the membranous skin covering the bones of quadrupeds.</p>

  <p>EPIPHRAGM. The membranaceous or calcareous substance by which some
  species of molluscs close the aperture of the shell, when they retire
  within it to hibernate. When the animal wishes to come forth from his
  hiding-place, again to breathe the air, the edges of the Epiphragm are
  detached by a chemical process, so that it drops off. The name
  Hibernaculum has also been given to this covering. It must not be
  confounded with the operculum, which is a permanent portion of the shell,
  and is used as a door, fitted to the foot of the animal and moved at will
  to open or close the aperture of the shell, whereas the Epiphragm is
  produced for the occasion from a mucous secretion of the animal and
  dissolved at the edges when no longer wanted, when it drops off.</p>

  <p>EPISTYLA. Sw. A subgenus of the genus <span class="sc">Helix</span>.
  E. conical. Sw. Helix Epistylium, fig. 281.</p>

  <p>EPONIDES. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>EQUILATERAL. (Æquus, equal; latus, side.) Equal-sided. A term applied
  to bivalve shells, when a line drawn down perpendicularly from the apex
  would divide the shell into two equal parts. <i>Ex.</i> Pectunculus
  pilosus, fig. 134.</p>

  <p>EQUIVALVE. (Æquus, equal; <i>valva</i>, a valve.) A term applied to a
  bivalve shell when the valves are equal to each other in dimensions.</p>

  <p>ERATO. Risso. <i>Fam.</i> Convolutæ, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Ovate,
  more or less angulated, smooth or granulated, with a dorsal scar; spire
  short; aperture large, angulated, emarginated; columella slightly
  crenated; outer lip reflected, denticulated on the inner edge. Suture of
  the whorls covered with enamel.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of shells
  resembles Marginella in form, but has no folds on the columella. Having a
  scar or groove down the back it may be considered intermediate between
  Marginella and Cypræa. Fig. 454, E. Maugeriæ. In the Author's
  Conchological Illustrations, seven species are enumerated and
  figured.</p>

  <p>ERUCA. Sw. A subgenus of Clausilia. Sw. Malac. p. 334.</p>

  <p>ERVILIA. Turt. A genus described as "oval, equivalve, equilateral,
  closed. Hinge with a single erect tooth closing between two small
  diverging ones in the opposite valve: lateral teeth none. Ligament
  internal. E. nitens. Turt. Mya. nitens, Auct."</p>

  <p>ERYCINA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Mactracea, Lam. Conchacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Ovate or triangular, transverse, equivalve,
  inequilateral, smooth; hinge with a ligamentary pit, two diverging
  cardinal and two lateral teeth in each valve; muscular impressions two in
  each valve; palleal impressions sinuated. East and West Indies and
  Mediterranean.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from
  <i>Mactra</i> and <i>Lutraria</i> by the cardinal teeth being placed one
  on each side of the ligamentiferous pit; whereas in the last named genera
  they are both placed on the anterior side. Fig. 86, E. Plebeja.</p>

  <p>ERYTHRÆA. The ancient name for <span class="sc">Cypræa</span>.</p>

  <p>ESCUTCHEON. The impression on the posterior dorsal margin of some
  bivalve shells. That on the anterior margin is named the lunule. The
  escutcheon is pointed out by the letter <i>e</i> in some of the figures
  of Cythereæ. Fig. 117, <i>a. b. c.</i></p>

  <p>ETHERIA. Lam. (<i>Æther</i>, air.) Fam. Chamacea, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Irregular, inequivalve, inequilateral,
  foliaceous, pearly within, covered by an olive green epidermis without;
  hinge callous, undulated, destitute of teeth; ligament partly external,
  partly internal, passing through the hinge on a somewhat raised, callous
  area in the lower valve. Muscular impressions elongated, two in each
  valve, united by a slender palleal impression. Rivers of
  Africa.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The irregular, unequal air-bubbles of the inner
  surface, whence this genus derives its name, are very brilliant in some
  species, and atone, in some measure, for the rugged ugliness of the
  exterior. In its irregular form, foliated structure, and toothless hinge,
  it resembles <span class="sc">Ostrea</span>, from which it differs in
  having two muscular impressions. Fig. 155, E. semilunata.</p>

  <p>EULIMA. Risso. <i>Fam.</i> Scalariens, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Elongated, smooth, pyramidal; spire long, composed of numerous whorls;
  apex acute, slightly tortuous; aperture oval, rounded anteriorly, acute
  at the posterior union with the body whorl; outer lip slightly thickened;
  columella smooth. Fig. 347, E. labiosa, fig. 348, E. splendidula. A
  complete illustrated monograph of this genus of pretty shining little
  shells, consisting of 15 known species, is given in parts 52 and 53 of
  the Conchological Illustrations by the author.</p>

  <p>EUOMPHALUS. Sow. <i>Fam.</i> Scalariens, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Orbicular, planorbular spire, with three or four volutions, imbricated
  above; smooth below; aperture of a round polygonal form; umbilicus large,
  penetrating to the apex of the shell.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of
  fossils very nearly resembles Delphinula. The main difference appears to
  be that the whorls do not increase so rapidly in size in the former as in
  the latter. Fossil, in the Carboniferous Limestone. Fig. 350.</p>

  <p>EXOGYRA. Sow. A genus of fossil bivalves, resembling Chama in shape
  and Ostræa in structure, having but one muscular impression in each
  valve. Fig. 183.</p>

  <p>EXSERTED. Standing out, protruding.</p>

  <p>EXTERNAL. An external shell is one which contains the animal, and is
  not covered by the mantle.</p>

  <p>FASCIATED. (<i>fascia</i>, a band.) Banded or striped. Ex. Carocolla
  marginata, fig. 277.</p>

  <p>FASCICULATED. (from fasciculum.) A little bunch of hairs or bristles
  against each end of each valve, characterizes some species of the genus
  Chiton, which are termed fasciculated species.</p>

  <p>FASCIOLARIA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam. Siphonostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Elongated, fusiform, ventricose; spire conical,
  consisting of few rounded or angulated whorls; aperture wide, terminating
  in a long straight open canal: columella lip with several oblique folds,
  the lower of which is larger than the rest; operculum horny,
  pyriform.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is known from Fusus by the folds
  on the columella; from Turbinella, by their obliquity and the last being
  larger than the rest. Fig. 386, F. Trapezium. East and West Indies and
  Australia.</p>

  <p>FAUNUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Melanopsis</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>FERRUGINEOUS. Of an iron rust colour.</p>

  <p>FERUSSINA. Grateloup. <span class="sc">Strophostoma</span>,
  Deshayes.</p>

  <p>FIBROUS. A shell is said to be of a fibrous structure when a fracture
  would present a series of perpendicular fibres, as Pinna.</p>

  <p>FICULA. Sw. A generic group of shells, consisting of those species of
  <span class="sc">Pyrula</span>, Auct. which have the true pear-shaped
  character. Fig. 390, P. Ficus. Sowerby confines the name Pyrula to these
  species.</p>

  <p>FIMBRIA. Megerle. <span class="sc">Corbis</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>FIMBRIATED. Fringed; as Murex fimbriatus, a delicate white species,
  with broad fringed varices.</p>

  <p>FISSURE. (<i>Fissura</i>, a slit.) A slit or cut, a narrow
  perforation, as in Emarginula and Fissurella.</p>

  <p>FISSURELLA. Brug. (<i>Fissura</i>, a fissure.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Calyptracia, Lam. Branchifera, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Patelliform, oval
  or oblong, radiated; apex anterior, perforated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  Fissurellæ are known from Patellæ by the perforation in the apex. Fig.
  245. The catalogue published by the author in the Conchological
  Illustrations, enumerates 68 species.</p>

  <p>FISTULANA. Lam. (<i>Fistula</i>, a pipe.) <i>Fam.</i> Tubicolæ, Lam.
  Adesmacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> A transversely elongated, equivalve,
  inequilateral bivalve, enclosed by a septum within the widest, closed
  extremity of a straight calcareous tube. Fistulana is known from
  Gastrochæna by the straightness of the tubes, and the oblong state of the
  valves. Fig. 54, Fistulana Clava.</p>

  <p>FLEXUOUS. Having windings or bendings. <i>Ex.</i> The Tellinæ are
  known by the twist or flexuosity in the posterior ventral margin of the
  shell.</p>

  <p>FLORILLUS. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>FLUVIATILE. (Fluviatilis.) Belonging to a river or running stream.
  <i>Ex.</i> Limnæa fluviatilis.</p>

  <p>FLUVIATILE CONCHACEA. See <span class="sc">Conchacea</span>.</p>

  <p>FOLIATED, or FOLIACEOUS. (From <i>folium</i>, a leaf.) When the edges
  of the successive layers of which a shell is composed are not compacted
  but placed apart from each other, projecting like tiles, the shell is
  said to be of a foliated structure. The common Oyster, fig. 180, presents
  a familiar example.</p>

  <p>FORAMINIFERA. D'Orb. (<i>Foramen</i>, a hole or pit.) An order
  established for minute many chambered internal shells, which have no open
  chamber beyond the last partition. Lamarck, D'Orbigny, and other writers
  have placed them among the Cephalopoda in their systems, but Du Jardin,
  on comparing the fossils with some recent species of the same class,
  arrived at the conclusion, now generally adopted, that they constitute a
  distinct class, much lower in degree of organization than even the
  Radiata. Not recognizing these microscopic bodies as shells, properly so
  called, but considering them sufficiently numerous and interesting to
  form a distinct branch of study, I do not think it desirable to describe
  the genera, or to present any arrangement of them in this work.</p>

  <p>FORNICATED. Arched or vaulted, as the exfoliations on the costæ of
  Tridacna Elongata, fig. 157.</p>

  <p>FOSSIL SHELL. A shell is considered to be in a fossil state when, the
  soft parts having ceased to exist, it is deprived of all its animal
  juices, has lost all, or nearly all its natural colour, and is thus
  changed in its chemical composition, when little or nothing is left but a
  mere bone, which is embedded in a sedimentary deposit. In this state, it
  is fragile, prehensile to the tongue, and either destitute of colour or
  tinged with the diluted mineral matters which pervade the stratum in
  which it lies. In some cases, the mineral composition of the shell is so
  completely changed as no longer to present its proper structure,
  consisting of successive oblique layers of shelly matter; but is altered
  into a fibrous structure, composed of rhomboidal particles. An example of
  this will be found in the Belemnites, which if broken, shew the
  perpendicular fibres. In other cases, the matter which has entered and
  filled up the cavities of the shell has become silicified, or changed
  into flint, and the shell itself has been decomposed and fallen off, so
  as to leave nothing but an external or internal cast of its form, in
  flint. This is called a Conchyliomorphite by continental writers. Some of
  the most important of Geological data are obtained by a minute comparison
  of fossil shells, found in various beds, with recent ones presenting the
  nearest resemblance to them. Some species of fossil shells are considered
  as identical with recent species. And many Geologists seek to fix the
  chronology of the different strata by the number of species which they
  inclose bearing a resemblance to the recent species. Indeed, all who
  would study Geology with success, will find it indispensably necessary to
  obtain a thorough knowledge of Conchology.</p>

  <p>FRAGELLA. Sw. A sub-genus of Monodonta, corresponding with the genus
  Clanculus, Montf. consisting of M. Pharaonis (fig. 361), and similar
  species. Sw. p. 352.</p>

  <p>FRAGILE. (<i>Fragilis.</i>) Tender, easily broken.</p>

  <p>FREE SHELL. One that is not attached.</p>

  <p>FREE VALVE. In attached bivalve shells, one only is fixed; the other
  is then <i>free</i>, as far as to the action of opening and shutting.</p>

  <p>FRESH-WATER SHELLS, (sometimes described as aquatic) are those which
  either inhabit rivers, running pools and ditches, in which case they are
  <i>fluviatile</i>; or wells and ponds of standing water, &amp;c.
  Fresh-water shells are either thin and horny in their texture, as the
  Limneana of Lamarck; or are covered with a compact, smooth, horny
  epidermis. They are generally simple in form, subject to corrosion where
  the epidermis is wounded or broken, and are circumscribed with regard to
  the classes and genera to which they belong. The family of Nayades
  includes nearly all the fresh-water bivalves; and the Melaniana and
  Limneana are the principal among univalves.</p>

  <p>FRONDICULARIA. Defr. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>FRONT. The surface of a shell on which the aperture appears.</p>

  <p>FULCRUM. That part of a shell on which any other part rests or turns.
  The term is applied more particularly to the tumid part in the hinge of
  bivalve shells on which the ligament is fixed.</p>

  <p>FULGUR. Montf. <span class="sc">Pyrula</span> perversa, Auct. and such
  other species as have an angulated spire. Fig. 388.</p>

  <p>FUSIFORM. (<i>Fusus</i>, a spindle.) Shaped like a spindle, swelling
  in the centre and tapering at the extremities. <i>Ex.</i> Fusus, fig.
  387.</p>

  <p>FUSUS. Brug. (A spindle.) <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam. Siphonostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Fusiform, turrited, with many rounded whorls;
  aperture generally oval, terminating in a long straight canal; operculum
  horny, pyriform.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Fusi are subject to considerable
  variations in form. The recent species are numerous and do not appear to
  be confined to any climate. The fossil species are also numerous, chiefly
  abounding in the tertiary formations. The recent species are mostly
  tropical. Fig. 387, F. Colus.</p>

  <p>GALATHÆA. Brug. <span class="sc">Potamophila</span>, Sow. <span
  class="sc">Megadesma</span>, Bowd.</p>

  <p>GALEA. Klein. <span class="sc">Purpura</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>GALEOLARIA. Lam. (From Galea, a helmet or crest.) A genus composed of
  species of <span class="sc">Serpula</span>, Auct. Distinguished as being
  fixed by the side of the shell, and having the anterior extremity erect,
  the aperture terminating in a tongue-shaped projection.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus is said by Lamarck to resemble Vermilia in other respects, but
  to differ in having the anterior part raised. Fig. 6, G. decumbens.
  Africa and Australia.</p>

  <p>GALEOMMA. Turt. <i>Fam.</i> <span class="sc">Pholadaria</span>,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, oval, equivalve, equilateral, with the
  ventral margin gaping; hinge with one cardinal tooth in each valve;
  muscular impressions two, approximate; palleal impression interrupted,
  not sinuated; ligament small, partly internal, partly external, fixed on
  a prominent fulcrum.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The wide hiatus in the ventral
  margins of this equilateral shell prevents the possibility of confounding
  it with any other. Four or five recent species are known, one of which is
  found on the coast of Sicily, and also in the British Channel. G.
  Turtoni, fig. 58.</p>

  <p>GALERICULUS. (<i>Galericulum</i>, a little cap or bonnet.) <span

  title="pous, podos" class="grk">&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;,
  &pi;&omicron;&delta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>pus</i>, <i>podos</i>, a
  foot.) The second order of the class Mollusca, Lam. containing those
  molluscous animals whose organs of locomotion are ventral. Most of the
  shells belonging to this order are patelliform, placed upon the back of
  the animals, which rest or crawl upon the belly. This order is divided
  into Pneumonobranchiata, that is, those which breath air, or land
  molluscs; and Hydrobranchiata, or those which breath water, marine or
  fresh-water molluscs. Fig. 227 to 263.</p>

  <p>GASTRANEA. Schum.? <span class="sc">Corbula</span>, Auct.</p>

  >&Gamma;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;&eta;&rho;</span>, <i>gaster</i>, belly; <span
  title="chaino" class="grk">&chi;&alpha;&iota;&nu;&omicron;</span>,
  <i>chaino</i>, gape.) <i>Fam.</i> Pholadaria, Lam. Pyloridea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, regular, inequilateral, with a wide,
  oblique, ventral hiatus, enclosed in a curved pyriform tube. Differing
  from Galeomma in being a free, oblique shell; from Fistulana, in the oval
  shape of the valves, and the curve of the tube; from Aspergillum and
  Clavagella, in both valves being free.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Gastrochænæ
  are found in the hollows of massive shells or other marine substances.
  Fig. 62, G. Modiolina.</p>

  <p>GASTROPLAX. Bl. <span class="sc">Umbrella</span>, Lam. De Blainville
  described this genus from a specimen in which the shell had been,
  probably by accident, placed upon the under part of the animal, and not
  discovering his error until afterwards, gave it the above name.</p>

  <p>GEOMITRA. Sw. A sub-genus of Geotrochus, Sw. founded on a trochiform
  species of Helix, with coronated nodules on the whorls. Helix bicarinata,

  Pithohelix, Geotrochus, Hemitrochus, Gonidormus, and Geomitra. Sw. p. 165
  and 166, described at page 331.</p>

  <p>GEOVULA. Sw. A sub-genus of Melampus (Auricula), consisting of oval
  species, resembling Auricula Midæ, fig. 297.</p>

  <p>GERVILLIA. Defr. <i>Fam.</i> Margaritacea, Bl. Malleacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, oblong, oblique; hinge long,
  straight, having small, irregular, transverse ligamentary
  pits.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of fossil shells, found at various
  geological periods, from the Lias to the Baculite limestone in Normandy,
  is now extinct. In general form it resembles Avicula, but in the hinge it
  approaches Perna. Fig. 169, G. Avicularis.</p>

  <p>GIBERULA. Sw. A genus separated from <span
  class="sc">Marginella</span>, Auct. and thus described, "sub-oval; spire
  slightly prominent; top of the outer lip dilated and gibbous; base of the
  inner lip with plaits; inner lip broad, spreading. G. Zonata. Enc. Méth.

  Equivalve, inequilateral, sub-cuneiform, rounded anteriorly,
  sub-rostrated posteriorly; hinge with three cardinal teeth, a series of
  five or six irregular, small, diverging teeth behind the umbones, and one
  lateral anterior tooth in each valve; ligament external; muscular

  columella laminar, flat, <span class="correction" title="Original reads 'obilque'."
  >oblique</span>; a spiral series of perforations running along the dorsal
  margin.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The splendid shells belonging to this genus are
  remarkable for the pearly iridescence of the inner surface, and the row
  of holes following the course of the spire. The soft parts are eaten in
  Guernsey and Jersey, and reckoned delicious. They belong to temperate and
  tropical climates. Fig. 338, H. rubra. 339, Padollus, Montf.</p>

  <p>HAMITES. Parkinson. (<i>Hamus</i>, a hook.) <i>Fam.</i> Ammonacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Elongated, cylindrical, chambered, recurved at
  the smaller extremity, annulated; septa lobed and
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs</i>. This remarkable fossil from the Baculite
  limestone in Normandy, differs from Baculites in being curved at one
  extremity, a circumstance from which its name is derived. Some small
  species are found in Chalk-Marle, Folkstone. Fig. 484*. H.
  cylindricus.</p>

  <p>HARPA. Brug. (<i>Harpa</i>, a harp.) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.
  Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, ventricose, longitudinally
  and regularly costated; spire short, with rounded, dome-like whorls;
  aperture wide, emarginated; outer lip thickened, reflected, composing the
  last costa or rib; inner lip polished, spread over part of the body
  whorl, terminating in a point.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This beautiful genus of
  shells is so clearly defined by the regular, longitudinal ribs that adorn
  the external surface, suggesting the idea of a stringed instrument, that
  there is no danger of confounding it with any other. H. multicostata,
  (Buccinum costatum, Linn.) and H. ventricosa, are among the most elegant
  of the testaceous productions of the sea both in form and colouring; the
  former is rare. The recent species are not numerous, they inhabit the
  Indian Ocean. A fossil species occurs at Grignon, near Paris. Fig. 419,
  H. ventricosa.</p>

  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Globose, compressed, or angulated, generally
  light and thin; aperture trigonal or semilunar; outer lip thickened and
  generally more or less reflected; inner lip spread over the body whorl,
  frequently callous near the columella, which is short, and terminates in
  a notch, angle, or slight callosity.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of land
  shells, distinguished from the genus Helix, by having an operculum and a
  thickened columellar lip, differs also from Cyclostoma in having the
  aperture semicircular or angular, the peritreme discontinuous and the
  operculum concentric. These shells are generally small in size, and
  simple in form. Lamarck describes only three or four species. Mr. Gray
  described some others in the Zoological Journal, and in a work shortly to
  be published by the author, a monograph of the genus will contain
  descriptions and figures of at least 60 distinct species; some of which
  have been lately brought to this country by Mr. Cuming from the
  Philippine Islands. They mostly belong to tropical climates.</p>

  aperture oblique, peritreme reflected, interrupted by the most prominent
  part of the body whorl; columella confluent with the outer lip, and
  contiguous to the axis of the shell. No operculum; a thin
  epidermis.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The land shells composing this genus are
  found in all parts of the world; the common snail, H. Aspersa, is well
  known as a destructive animal in our gardens. The genera Helix, Achatina,
  Bulinus, Clausilia, Anostoma, &amp;c., have been united under one generic
  name by De Ferussac, and again divided under the following sub-generic
  names, each of which we shall illustrate by a figure. <span

  an example of each of these sub-divisions, for the sake of presenting the
  reader with the principal variations to which the genus is subject. The
  established genera will be characterized in their places. Fig. 254 to

  title="onux" class="grk">&omicron;&nu;&upsilon;&xi;</span>, <i>onyx</i>,
  nail or hoof.) <i>Fam.</i> Rudistes, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Inequivalve, sub-equilateral, rather irregular, destitute of ligament and
  hinge teeth; lower valve attached, flat, sub-orbicular, with a muscular
  impression, composed of two lunulate portions, meeting at one extremity,
  and presenting the form of a horse-shoe; upper valve conical, with the
  apex inclined backwards, and the muscular impression
  marginal.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The earlier naturalists having only met with
  the upper valve of these shells, placed them among the patelliform
  univalves; to some of which, particularly Pileopsis, they bear a very
  strong resemblance. The species of Hipponyx are numerous, and till lately
  only known in a fossil state. The recent species belong to tropical
  climates: the fossil species are found in the tertiary beds. Fig. 199, H.
  Cornucopia.</p>

  <p>HIPPOPODIUM. Conybeare. <i>Fam.</i> Cardiacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, obliquely transverse, heavy, deep,
  inequilateral, umbones incurved; ventral margin sinuated, so as to give a
  bilobed appearance to the shell; hinge incrassated, with one rugged
  oblique tooth.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> These fossils are found in the upper
  beds of Lias. Fig. 129, H. Ponderosum.</p>

  <p>HIPPOPUS. Lam. (<span title="Hippos" class="grk"
  >&#x1F39;&pi;&pi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, hippus; <span title="pous" class="grk"
  >&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>pous</i>, foot.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Tridacnacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, regular,
  subquadrate; lunule closed, flat, with crenulated edges; ventral margin
  deeply undulated; external surface fluted, with radiating ribs, which are
  transversely fringed with rows of tubular spines; hinge margin thick,
  with two long, compressed posterior lateral teeth in one valve, three in
  the other; ligament marginal, external.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shell thus
  described is rightly separated from Tridacna, on account of the anterior
  dorsal margins being closed; whereas in Tridacna there is a wide hiatus.
  Only one species of this genus is known, which receives its name from its
  resemblance in form to a horse's foot, when held with the flat anterior
  dorsal margin downwards. Few shells are found to concentrate so many
  beauties as the Hippopus Maculatus, commonly called the Bear's-paw-clam;
  the delicate whiteness of the interior, the undulating edge, the radiated
  fluted columns, adorned at intervals by crisped fringes, and the richness
  of the variegated colouring, are such as to secure the admiration of the
  most superficial observer. From the Indian Archipelago. Fig. 156, H.
  Maculatus.</p>

  <p>HIPPURITES. Montf. <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Lam. Rudistes,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Tabular, rude, irregular, attached; lower valve
  cylindrical, more or less lengthened, apparently divided into sections by
  septa (considered by some authors as merely projecting layers of growth)
  having one or two lateral tubes within; upper valve round, flat, fixed on
  the aperture of the tubular valve like an operculum.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus is known only in a fossil state, and but very imperfectly.
  Lamarck places it among his chambered Cephalopoda, &amp;c. De Blainville,
  considering it a true Bivalve, enumerates it among his Rudistes.

  triangular opening at the upper part where the dorsal portion advances
  beyond the ventral; ventral portion vaulted; dorsal more flat; lower
  extremity tridentate.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The singular structures composing
  this genus were formerly taken for bivalves, and named Anomia
  Tricuspidata, &amp;c. They are now known to belong to the class of
  molluscous animals, called Pteropoda, from the wing-shaped organs of
  locomotion. A species of Hyalæa occurs in Sicily in a fossil state.

  spire short, consisting of few whorls; aperture angulated, at the
  anterior junction of the inner and outer lips; columella tortuous,
  contiguous to the axis; outer lip thin, sinuated in the
  centre.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells composing this genus are celebrated
  for their beautiful purple colour. The animal possesses a small vesicular
  process, which keeps it floating on the surface of the water; it exudes a
  purple secretion when irritated. It is occasionally floated on to the
  shores of most temperate and tropical countries. Fig. 333, J.
  Fragilis.</p>

  when the superficial laminæ are arranged over each other in the manner of
  tiles.</p>

  <p>IMPERATOR. Montf. A genus composed of species of the genus <span
  class="sc">Trochus</span>, Auct. with whorls angulated and stellated,
  having an umbilicus. <i>Ex.</i> T. Imperialis. Some of the shells named
  Imperator in the British Museum belong to the genus Calcar, Montf. having
  no umbilicus.</p>

  <p>IMPRESSION. See <span class="sc">Muscular Impression</span>.</p>

  <p>INCRASSATED. (<i>Crassus</i>, thick.) Thickened, as the hinge of
  Glycimeris, fig. 67.</p>

  <p>INCURVED. Turned inwards or bent forwards. Applied to symmetrical
  shells, when the point of the apex turns towards the anterior extremity,
  as in Patella. The apex of a shell is said to be incurved when it is bent
  inwards, but not sufficiently so to be described as spiral. <i>Ex.</i>
  Ammonoceras, Lam. fig. 477.</p>

  <p>INDENTED. (<i>In</i>, in; <i>dens</i>, a tooth.) Exactly the reverse
  of <span class="sc">Dentated</span>; meaning a series of small cavities,
  such as might be produced by the entrance of teeth. The cast of a
  dentated surface would be indented.</p>

  <p>INEQUILATERAL. (<i>Æquus</i>, equal; <i>latus</i>, a side.) A term
  applied to a bivalve shell when its extent on one side of the umbones is
  greater than that on the other. When the sides are nearly equal, the term
  <i>sub-equilateral</i> is used.</p>

  <p>INEQUIVALVE. (<i>in</i>; <i>æquus</i>, equal; <i>valva</i>, valve.)
  The two principal valves differing from each other in diameter or
  convexity.</p>

  <p>INFERIOR VALVE is that which is attached to sub-marine bodies. Only
  applied to attached bivalves.</p>

  <p>INFEROBRANCHIATA. Bl. The fourth family of the second section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica, Bl. containing no testaceous mollusca.</p>

  <p>INFLATED. Swelled, as Bulla, fig. 250, 252. This term can only be
  applied to rotund shells of a light, thin texture. In other cases we
  should use the word <span class="sc">Ventricose</span>.</p>

  <p>INFLECTED. Turned inwards. This term is applied to the outer lip of a
  spiral shell when it turns towards the body whorl. This is the case in
  Cypræa, fig. 446. See <span class="sc">Reflected</span>.</p>

  <p>INFUNDIBULUM. Montf. (<i>A funnel.</i>) A genus formed of those
  species of <span class="sc">Calyptræa</span>, Lam. which, having a spiral
  septum, so nearly resemble Trochus that some authors have placed them in
  that genus. One species named Patella Trochiformis. Recent from South
  America, fossil from the tertiary beds. Fig. 237, 238, Calyptræa
  (Infundibulum) Pileus.</p>

  <p>INNER LIP. That edge of the aperture of an univalve shell which is
  near to the imaginary axis, as distinguished from the outer lip, or that
  which is on the opposite side.</p>

  <p>INOCERAMUS. Sow. <i>Fam.</i> Malleacea, Lam. Margaritacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thick, inequivalve, sub-equilateral, triangular,
  deep, with the umbones incurved; hinge formed of a series of transverse
  grooves.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The larger valves of these fossil shells
  resemble the larger valve of Gryphæa; but the hinge is quite distinct.
  The species described in Mineral Conchology are found in the blue marl,
  at Folkstone, and in the chalk. I. Lamarckii, (Catillus, Brong.) fig.
  167.</p>

  <p>INTERNAL CAST. The mould of a fossil shell, composed of matter which
  entered the shell in a soft state, and has subsequently hardened, when,
  the shell dropping off, the hardened substance which filled it is left to
  represent its internal form.</p>

  <p>INTERNAL LIGAMENT. A term used by some conchological writers
  signifying that the ligament of a bivalve shell is placed within the
  closed part of the hinge, so as not to be seen when the valves are shut.
  But the substance, formerly called the internal ligament, is now
  distinguished from the true ligament both in structure and use; and is
  now more properly called the cartilage, so that when the ligament is said
  to be internal, it must be understood that the internal cartilage is
  unaccompanied by any ligament properly so called, and when a shell is
  described as having two ligaments, as in the case of Amphidesma, it means
  that the two substances are so far removed from each other in the hinge
  that they are no longer confounded together.</p>

  <p>INTERNAL SHELL is one which is enclosed in the soft parts of the
  animal, as a bone is enclosed in the flesh of a human body. The Limax, or
  common garden slug, which has a testaceous shield beneath its mantle, is
  an instance of this.</p>

  <p>IO. Lea. A genus composed of several species of fresh-water shells
  which are considered as differing from Melaniæ in having the anterior
  termination of the aperture produced into a point in some degree
  resembling the caudal canals of shells belonging to the family of
  Canalifera, which are marine. Io fusiformis and spinosus are described
  and figured in Lea's work on the genus Unio.</p>

  <p>JODAMIA. Defr. A genus resembling Birostrites, except that in Jodamia
  one valve overwraps the other, while in Birostrites the circumference of
  the valves is equal.</p>

  <p>IPHIGENIA. Gray. A sub-genus of Clausilia, C. biplicata, &amp;c. Auct.
  Gray's Turton, p. 214.</p>

  <p>IRIDEA. Sw. A genus of "Hyrianæ," Sw. thus described:&mdash;"Oblong
  ovate; bosses small, depressed, sulcated; inner cardinal tooth placed
  beneath the outer. I. granosa, <i>Lam.</i> En. Méth. 248. fig. 9."</p>

  <p>IRIDINA. Auct. A genus belonging to the Nayades, and resembling the
  <span class="sc">Anodontæ</span>, Auct. but its peculiar characteristic
  is that the hinge lamina is tuberculated or crenulated in its whole
  length. Sowerby unites all the genera of the family into the genus <span
  class="sc">Unio</span>. Fig. 150, I. Elongata.</p>

  <p>IRREGULAR SHELLS, are those which, being attached to, or imbedded in
  other marine bodies, have no constant form, but are modified in shape
  according to the substances to which they are fixed, as the Chamacea,
  fig. 153 to 155.</p>

  regular, equivalve, ventricose, with distant, diverging, involute, free
  umbones; hinge with two compressed cardinal, and one distant, compressed
  lateral teeth in each valve; ligament external, bifid, diverging in the
  direction of the umbones.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells composing this
  genus are remarkable for the beautiful curvature of the diverging
  umbones. European and Chinese Seas. Fig. 126, I. Moltkiana.</p>

  <p>KEEL. A flattened ridge, resembling the keel of a ship. As that on the
  back of Carinaria vitrea, fig. 488, and those on the whorls of some
  spiral shells. A shell characterized by a keel or keels is said to be
  carinated.</p>

  aperture which is nearest to the axis and generally contiguous to the
  body whorl. The lower part of this, when sufficiently distinct from that
  part which overwraps the body whorl, is called the Columella.</p>

  <p>LABRUM, or outer lip,&mdash;is the edge of the aperture at the
  greatest distance from the axis.</p>

  convolute, symmetrical; aperture notched; chambers few in number; visible
  on the exterior, radiating from the centre of the disk.</p>

  <p>LEPADICEA. Bl. The first family of the class Nemantopoda, Bl. This
  family consists of the same animals which constitute the Pedunculated
  Cirripedes of Lamarck, and part of the genus Lepas in the system of
  Linnæus. It contains the genera Gymnolepas, Pentalepas, Polylepas and
  Litholepas.</p>

  <p>LEPAS. (<span title="Lepas" class="grk"
  >&Lambda;&epsilon;&pi;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>lepas</i>, a rock.) The
  Linnæan name Lepas contains all the Cirripedes or Multivalves, the
  different kinds of which are not distinguished in the accounts given by
  early writers of the habits of the animals. (Fig. 14 to 43.) It was
  formerly applied to the Limpets or Patella. In fact, the ancient
  definition was "Concha petræ adhærens," and would apply to any shells
  attached to rocks.</p>

  <p>LEPTÆNA. Dalman. A genus belonging to the Brachiopoda; and thus
  described:&mdash;"Hinge compressed, rectilinear, frequently exceeding the
  width of the shell." It forms part of the genus Producta, Sow. Fig. 206,
  L. depressa.</p>

  <p>LEPTOCONCHUS. Rüppell. (<span title="Leptos" class="grk"
  >&Lambda;&epsilon;&pi;&tau;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>leptus</i>, thin;
  <span title="Konchos" class="grk"
  >&Kappa;&omicron;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>conchos</i>,
  shell.) This shell resembles a young <span class="sc">Magilus</span> in
  general appearance, although the animal is said to differ. In the young
  Magilus also, the inner lip is reflected over the body whorl, which is
  not the case in Leptoconchus. Red Sea. Fig. 11.</p>

  <p>LEPTOCONUS. Sw. A sub-genus of Conus, consisting of Conus grandis,
  amadis, duplicatus, Australis, &amp;c. Sw. p. 312.</p>

  <p>LEPTOLIMNEA. Sw. A sub-genus of Limnea, described as being nearly
  cylindrical. Limnea elongata, Sow. Gen. fig. 6.</p>

  <p>LEPTON. Turton. <span class="sc">Solen</span> Squamosus, Montague, and
  other species described as "flat, nearly orbicular, equivalve,
  inequilateral, a little open at the sides. Hinge of one valve with a
  single tooth, and a transverse linear lateral one on each side; of the
  other valve, with a cavity in the middle and a transverse deeply cloven
  lateral tooth each side, the segments of which divaricate from the beak."
  To represent this genus we have figured L. Squamosum in the plates, fig.
  62. British.</p>

  <p>LEPTOSPIRA. Sw. A sub-genus of Bulinus, thus described: "Spire
  excessively long, sub-cylindrical; body whorl largest; outer lip
  thickened; aperture oval; no teeth, striata, <i>Sw.</i> Chem. 135. f.
  1226. signata <i>Sw.</i>" Sw. p. 335.</p>

  <p>LEUCOSTOMA. Sw. A genus of "Achatina," Sw. described as resembling
  Achatinella, but having a "thick pad" at the top of the "upper lip," and
  another over the base. L. variegata, Sw. Lardn. Cyclop. Malac. fig. 24.
  p. 172.</p>

  <p>LEUCOTUS. Sw. A sub-genus of Natica, described as intermediate between
  Sigaretus and Lacuna. <span class="sc">Sigaretus</span>
  <i>cancellatus</i>, Lam. (Sw. Malac. p. 346.)</p>

  <p>LICIUM. Humph. <span class="sc">Ovula</span>, Lam. (Ovulum.)</p>

  <p>LIGAMENT. (From <i>Ligo</i>, to bind.) The true ligament is always
  external, and serves the purpose of binding the two valves of a shell
  together externally by the posterior dorsal margins. There is another
  substance, called by Gray the <i>Cartilage</i>, which is elastic and of a
  condensed fibrous structure, placed within the ligament, either close to
  it, or at a more interior part of the shell; it is sometimes contained in
  a pit, formed for its reception, in the centre of the hinge. This
  substance, being elastic, keeps the valves open, unless drawn together by
  the counteracting force of the adductor muscles. When conchologists speak
  of a shell as having the ligament external, the real meaning is that
  these two substances are so close together as in appearance to constitute
  one body placed outside the shell so as to be seen when the valves are
  closed. When two ligaments are spoken of, as in Amphidesma, the meaning
  is that the cartilage occupies a separate place on the hinge.</p>

  <p>LIGAMENTIFEROUS. (<i>Ligamentum</i>, a ligament, <i>fero</i>, to
  bear.) Having or containing the ligament, as the cardinal pit in Mya,
  fig. 71.</p>

  <p>LIGULA. Leach. A genus containing the more rounded and less gaping
  species of <span class="sc">Lutraria</span>, Auct. Fig. 77, Lutraria
  Papyracea.</p>

  <p>LIGULATE. (<i>Ligula</i>, a slip, a shoe-latchet.) Thin, slender, like
  a slip, or neck of any thing, as the anterior muscular impression of
  Lucina, fig. 104.</p>

  <p>LIGUMIA. Sw. A sub-genus of Unio, thus described:&mdash;"Very long and
  pod-shaped; bosses depressed; cardinal teeth moderate. S. recta. Lam. vi.
  1. p. 74." Sw. p. 378.</p>

  <p>LIGUUS. Montf. A genus containing species of <span
  class="sc">Achatina</span>, Auct. which have rounded apertures and
  lengthened spires, differing from his <span class="sc">Polyphemi</span>,
  which have lengthened apertures. A. virginea, Auct. fig. 286, is the type
  of this genus.</p>

  <p>LIMA. Brug. (<i>Lima</i>, a file.) <i>Fam.</i> Pectinides, Lam.
  Subostracea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral,
  compressed, oblique-auriculated, oval, radiately ribbed or striated,
  imbricated, covered with a light brown epidermis; hinge with a triangular
  disc between the umbones, divided in the centre by a triangular
  ligamentary pit without teeth; muscular impression one, sublateral,
  sub-orbicular.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells thus described are marine,
  two or three species being found on our coasts, and fossil species
  occurring in Lias, inferior Oolite, Calcaire-grossiér, &amp;c. They
  differ from Pecten in having a wide hiatus for the passage of a byssus,
  by which they are occasionally attached, and also in the triangular disc,
  which separates the umbones. The animal makes use of the valves of his
  shell as natatory organs, working them like fins or paddles, and by this
  means proceeding at a rapid rate through the waters. L. Squamosa, fig.
  174.</p>

  <p>LIMACINA. Cuv. (<i>Limax</i>, a snail.) <i>Fam.</i> Pteropoda,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Papyraceous, fragile, planorbicular,
  sub-carinated, obliquely convolute; spiral side rather prominent, the
  other side umbilicated; aperture large, entire, not modified, peristome
  sharp.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is <span class="sc">Spiratella</span>, Bl.
  The shell figured as Limacina in Sowerby's Genera, under "pteropoda," is
  an <i>Atlanta</i>. Our representation of Spiratella Limacinea, fig. 224.

  <p>LINES OF GROWTH. The concentric striæ or lines formed by the edges of
  the successive layers of shelly matter deposited by the animal by which
  it increases the shell. The outer edge of the aperture is always the last
  line of growth.</p>

  <p>LINGUIFORM. (<i>Lingua</i>, tongue; <i>forma</i>, form.)
  Tongue-shaped.</p>

  <p>LINGULA. Lam. (Dim. from <i>lingua</i>, tongue.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Brachiopoda, Lam. Palliobranchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve,
  oblong, depressed, thin, equilateral, gaping and pointed at the umbones,
  gaping and truncate or trilobate at the opposite extremities, attached by
  a fleshy pedicule fixed to the umbones.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is the
  only bivalve shell which is pedunculated, in which respect it constitutes
  a singular anomaly. The ancient writers, seeing the valves separate,
  placed it in their systems under the name Patella Unguis. There are
  several recent species found in the Moluccas, and some fossils in sandy
  indurated marl, and in alluvium of Suffolk. L. Anatina, fig. 219, is so
  named from its resemblance to a duck's bill.</p>

  Transverse, elongated, cylindrical, equivalve, with the extremities
  rounded, and the posterior extremity rostrated; umbones not prominent,
  terminal; hinge straight, destitute of teeth; ligament linear, most
  conspicuous within; muscular impressions two.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  shells composing this genus differ from Modiola, not only in the
  cylindrical form, but also in the circumstance from which the generic
  name is derived, i. e. of their living in stones. Thus, while the form
  and structure of the shell bring it near the Mytili or Muscle shells, the
  habits of the animal cause it to approach the Lithophagi, or rock-eating
  molluscs of Lamarck. L. Dactylus (fig. 161,) is the Mytilus Lithophagus

  fleshy, scaly at the upper extremity; fixed at the base in a patelliform
  shelly support.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus derives its name from the
  power possessed by the animal of making dwelling holes in stones or
  pieces of rock. The remarkable shelly cups at the base of the pedicle is
  regarded as analogous to the shelly base of the Balanus, so that this
  genus would form an intermediate link between the Sessile and
  Pedunculated Cirripedes of Lamarck. Fig. 39, L. dorsalis. West India

  <p>LITIOPA. Ranz. <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> "Shell
  not very thick, horny, with a slight epidermis, rather transparent,
  conical, with whorls somewhat rounded; the last being larger than all the
  rest together; with the apex pointed, longitudinally grooved; aperture
  oval, larger anteriorly than posteriorly, with the lips disunited, the
  right lip simple, separated from the left by a rather indistinct notch,
  or a slight emargination in the contour. The left lip slightly reflected
  backwards, so as to form a kind of salient margin with the anterior
  extremity of the columella, which is united, rounded, arcuated and
  slightly truncated at the anterior."&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Molluscous
  animals, whose shells are thus described, are found in the Mediterranean,
  and are remarkable for the power of suspending themselves from the
  sea-weed on which they live, by a thread resembling a spider's web. The
  general appearance of the shell presents a medium between Phasianella and
  Littorina, but it is apparently destitute of an operculum.</p>

  <p>LITTORINA. Fer. (<i>Littus</i>, the sea-shore.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Turbinacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turbinated, thick; spire acuminated,
  consisting of few whorls, about one third of the axis in length; aperture
  entire, large, rounded anteriorly; outer lip thickened within, acute;
  columella rather flattened; operculum horny, spiral, with rapidly
  increasing volutions.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells composing this genus
  are known from Turbo and Phasianella by the horny operculum; and from
  Trochus, which has also a horny operculum, by the small number of the
  whorls. The Littorinæ, among which may be enumerated the common
  Periwinkle, are, as the name implies, found on sea shores, feeding upon
  seaweed, in all parts of the world. Fig. 363, <i>L. Vulgaris</i>.</p>

  <p>LITUACEA. Bl. The second family of Polythalamacea. Bl. The shells are
  described as chambered, symmetrical, convolute in part of their extent,
  but constantly straight towards the termination. The genus Spirula, which
  is admitted into this family, does not properly belong to it, any more
  than to the Lituolæ of Lamarck, in which it is also placed. It does not
  agree with the descriptions of either. This family partly corresponds
  with the "Lituolées," Lam. and contains the genera Lituola,
  Ichthyosarcolites, Spirula, Hamites and Ammonoceras.</p>

  shells of which are described as partially spiral, the last whorl
  continuing in a straight line. The transverse septa which divide the
  chambers, are in general pierced by a siphon which breaks itself off
  before it reaches the succeeding septum. This family contains the genera
  of microscopic Foraminifera Lituola and Spirolina. The genus Spirula,

  of the umbo in one valve, one in the other; ligament external, partly
  hidden by the margins of the valves when closed. Muscular impressions two
  in each valve, the anterior one produced into an elongated, ligulate
  band, the posterior short and semi-rotund; impression of the mantle not
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells of this genus resemble Amphidesma
  in general form, but are distinguished by the external ligament, the
  elongated muscular impression, and the want of a sinus in the palleal
  impression. East and West Indies, and European shores. Fig. 104, L.

  The great proportion of shells belong to the former class, those of the
  latter two classes being limited in their number, and in the genera to
  which they belong.</p>

  <p>MARINULA. King. A genus of small shells resembling Auricula and
  Pedipes, described as "Ovate, sub-solid, with aperture ovate entire;
  columella bidentate, uniplicated towards the base, with large sub-remote
  teeth; the largest uppermost; no operculum."</p>

  <p>MARMAROSTOMA. Sw. A genus of "Trochidæ," Sw. thus described:
  "Umbilicus deep; spire of few whorls, much depressed, and obtuse; inner
  lip obsolete; base even more produced than in <i>Senectus</i>, but never
  distinctly channeled. M. versicolor. Mont. 176. f. 1740, 1741, undulata.
  Chem. 169. f. 1640, 1641," Sw. p. 348.</p>

  <p>MARPESSA. Gray. A sub-genus of Clausilia, C. bidens, &amp;c. Auct.
  Gray's Turton, p. 212.</p>

  <p>MARTESIA. Leach. A genus composed of those species of <span
  class="sc">Pholas</span>, Auct. which are described as short, cuneiform,
  nearly closed at both extremities, having several accessary pieces on the
  middle of the back, and two marginal, lower down.</p>

  <p>MEASUREMENT. The most approved method of stating the measurements of
  various kinds of shells is as follows: <i>symmetrical convolute
  univalves</i>, the length is from anterior to posterior; the depth from
  ventral to dorsal; the breadth, from side to side of the aperture. Of
  <i>symmetrical conical univalves</i>, length, from front to back; breadth
  from side to side; depth from apex to base. Of <i>spiral univalves</i>,
  length, from apex to anterior of the columella or axis of the shell;
  breadth, across from the outer lip to the opposite side. Of
  <i>non-symmetrical bivalves</i>, the length is from the anterior to the
  posterior margin; breadth, from the greatest convexity of one valve to
  the corresponding part of the other; depth, from the ventral to the
  dorsal margin.</p>

  <i>odos</i>, tooth.) <i>Fam.</i> Cardiacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, longitudinal, acuminated at the umbones, thick; hinge forming
  an incrassated septum across the cavity of the shell, with a large bifid
  tooth in the right valve, and one irregular and one pointed in the left;
  ligament long, external.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The general form, the
  thickened hinge reaching across the cavity of the valve and the terminal
  umbones serve to distinguish this genus from Cardita, to which, however,
  it is nearly allied. M. cucullatus, fig. 127.</p>

  <p>MEGALOMASTOMA. Guild. A sub-genus of Cyclostoma, thus described:
  "Cylindrical, resembling <i>Pupa</i>, but has a horny operculum; spire
  not thickened; teeth or fold on the pillar none, flavula <i>Sw.</i> En.
  Méth. 461. f. 6, brunnea <i>Guild.</i> (<i>fig. 97. g. h. 1.</i>)" Sw. p.
  336. Mr. Gray applies the name to those species which have "a groove or
  ridge in front of the mouth near the pillar."</p>

  <p>MEGARIMA. Rafinesque. A genus proposed to include species of <span
  class="sc">Terebratula</span>, Auct. which are smooth and nearly
  equivalve. T. lævis, T. crassa, T. truncula.</p>

  <p>MEGASPIRA. Lea. (<span title="Megas" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&epsilon;&gamma;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>megas</i>, great, and
  spire.) M. Ruschenbergiana, (fig. 294) is a pupiform land shell
  remarkable for the length of its spire, which consists of no less than
  twenty-five close set, narrow, gradually increasing whorls. The outer lip
  is simple, slightly thickened; the inner lip has a tooth on the
  body-whorl, and two folds on the columella. Only one species of this
  singular shell is known.</p>

  <p>MEGATREMA. Leach. A genus composed of those species of Pyrgoma, Auct.
  which have a large aperture. Fig. 33.</p>

  >&Mu;&epsilon;&lambda;&alpha;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>melas</i>, black.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Melaniens, Lam. Ellipsostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Turrited; spire generally elongated, acute; aperture entire, oval or
  oblong, pointed at the posterior extremity, rounded anteriorly, with a
  kind of indistinct canal or sinuosity: epidermis thick, generally
  black.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> In common with other fresh-water shells, the
  Melaniæ are frequently found with corroded apices. This genus is known
  from Melanopsis by the absence of the notch at the anterior part of the
  aperture. The Melaniæ occur in rivers of warm climates. The fossil
  species are frequent in upper marine formations. Fig. 313, M.
  subulata.</p>

  emarginated anteriorly; outer lip thin; columella slightly curved, with
  four or five laminar, oblique, prominent plaits.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  genus Melo has been separated from <i>Voluta</i> principally on account
  of the largeness of the aperture, the lightness of the shell and the
  thinness of the outer lip. Melo differs from Cymba in the regularity of
  the spiral apex, and in the greater rotundity of the shell. The Melons
  are beautifully coloured large shells, found in the seas of the old
  world. The Melo Indicus has a certain resemblance to a Melon. Fig. 435.

  brown epidermis; spire long, turrited, acute; aperture emarginated
  anteriorly; outer lip thickened; columella with several oblique, thick
  plaits.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The pretty small shells composing this genus
  differ from Marginella, not only in general form, but in the outer lip
  not being reflected. Some species of Voluta, of a more elongated shape
  than the rest, present a near approach to the most ventricose of the
  Mitræ. The apex of Mitra, however, is always acute, while that of Voluta
  is generally papillary. The aperture of the former is narrow and the
  inner lip thickened, the contrary being the case with the latter. The
  shells of this genus are varied in colouring which is generally rich; and
  also in form, some being angulated, some plicated, some coronated and
  others smooth. The species are mostly tropical; very few occur so far
  north as the Mediterranean. Fossil species are numerous in the Eocene
  beds. Fig. 431. M. Plicaria. Fig. 432. Conohelix marmorata, Sw.</p>

  <p>MITRELLA. Sw. A genus consisting of <span class="sc">Mitra</span>
  Fissurella, casta, Olivæformis, and similar species, described as "Rather
  small; olive-shaped; unequally fusiform; always smooth and polished, and
  sometimes covered with an epidermis; base obtuse and effuse; spire nearly
  or quite equal to the aperture; plaits of the pillar few, oblique, and
  extending beyond the aperture, which is smooth internally." Sw. p. 321.

  inequilateral, thin, with the anterior side short and narrow, slightly
  gaping to admit the passage of a byssus, and the posterior side
  elongated, broad, sub-quadrate; hinge thin, toothless, rectilinear, with
  a long, partly external ligament; muscular impressions two in each valve;
  palleal impression irregular, not sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus
  differs from Mytilus, to which the common muscle belongs, in the anterior
  margin being rounded out beyond the umbo, which in Mytilus is terminal.
  The Lithodomi may be known from this genus by their cylindrical form.

  <p>MOLLUSCA. (From <i>Mollis</i>, soft.) The twelfth class of
  invertebrated animals with univalve shells or none; divided into the
  following orders: Pteropoda, Gasteropoda, Trachelipoda, Cephalopoda,
  Heteropoda, fig. 220 to 488. The term mollusca is also used in a general
  sense to include the classes Conchifera and Mollusca of Lamarck,
  corresponding with the type Malacozoa of De Blainville.</p>

  Ovate, thick, covered with a brown epidermis; spire short, consisting of
  few whorls; aperture emarginated anteriorly; columella rather flat; outer
  lip thick, with a prominent tooth near the extremity.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus resembles Purpura, in every respect, except in having the
  tooth from which the name is derived. A catalogue of 16 species by Mr.
  Sowerby, sen. is published with figures of 14, in parts 58 to 67 of the
  Conchological Illustrations by the author. The species belong to the
  South American coasts of the Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>MONOCONDYLÆA. D'Orb. A sub-genus of Uniones, described as equivalve,
  inequilateral, sub-rotund or angulated; hinge consisting of a large,
  obtuse, round cardinal tooth in each valve, with no lateral teeth.
  Monocondylæ (Unio) Paraguayana, D'Orb. fig. 149.</p>

  <p>MONODONTA. Lam. <span class="sc">Odontis</span>, Sow. A genus
  separated from Trochus, Auct. on account of the tooth or notch with which
  the columella abruptly terminates. M. labeo, fig. 366.</p>

  <p>MONOICA. Bl. The second sub-class of the class Paracephalophora, Bl.
  divided into the orders Pulmobranchiata, Chismobranchiata,
  Monopleurobranchiata, in the first section; and Aporobranchiata,
  Polybranchiata, Cyclobranchiata, Inferobranchiata, and Nucleobranchiata,
  in the second.</p>

  <p>MONOMYARIA. Lam. (<span title="Monos" class="grk"
  >&Mu;&omicron;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>monos</i>, single; <span
  title="muon" class="grk">&mu;&upsilon;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>myon</i>,
  muscle.) The second order of Conchifera, consisting of those bivalve
  shells which have but <i>one</i> principal muscular impression in each
  valve. The Monomyaria are thus divided: First section, containing the
  families Tridacnacea, Mytilacea, Malleacea; second section, containing
  the families Pectinides, Ostracea; third section, containing the families
  Rudistes, Brachiopoda.</p>

  <p>MONOPLEUROBRANCHIATA. Bl. The second order of the first section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica. Bl. The animals are described as having the
  lungs branched, situated at the right side of the body and covered more
  or less completely by the operculiform mantle, in which there is
  sometimes enveloped either a flat or a more or less involute shell, with
  a large entire aperture. They have either rudimentary or auricular
  tentacula, or none. This order, which includes mollusca with haliotoid or
  patelliform shells, is divided into the following families: <i>Fam.</i>
  1. Subaplysiacea; 2. Aplysiacea; 3. Patelloidea; 4. Acera.</p>

  <p>MONOPTYGMA. Lea. A genus of small shells resembling Tornatella, but
  having a strong, oblique fold in the centre of the columellar lip. M.
  Elegans, fig. 344.</p>

  <p>MONOTHALAMIA. (<span title="Monos" class="grk"

  >&theta;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>thalamos</i>, chamber.) The second division of Cephalopoda, Lam.
  containing only one genus, namely Argonauta.</p>

  <p>MONOTHYRA. A term used by Aristotle to designate spiral univalves.</p>

  <p>MONOTIGMA. Gray. A genus founded on the species represented fig. 371.
  It is a turrited shell, but we are unacquainted with the characters of
  the genus.</p>

  <p>MORIO. Montf. <span class="sc">Cassidaria</span>, Auct. C.
  Echinophora, fig. 407.</p>

  <p>MOTHER OF PEARL. This beautiful substance, which is so much resorted
  to for ornamental purposes, constitutes the thickened coating of the
  internal surface of the shell named by scientific collectors, Meleagrina
  Margaritifera, commonly called the Pearl Oyster, a young specimen of
  which is figured (164) in our plates. The reason why this substance is
  called mother-of-pearl is that the true pearls are produced from its
  surface. They arise principally from accident or disease, and are
  sometimes artificially produced by pricking through the outside of the
  shell while the animal is living. The animal is allowed to live until it
  has formed a pearl over the wounded part.</p>

  <p>MOULINSIA. Grateloup. <span class="sc">Pupina</span>, Vignard. A genus
  of small land shells with enamelled surface and spiral operculum. See
  <span class="sc">Pupina</span>.</p>

  <p>MOURETIA. Gray. "<i>Gadin</i>," Adanson. A genus of patelliform
  shells, described as differing from <span class="sc">Siphonaria</span>
  (the original Mouretia of Adanson) in the situation of the siphon, which
  in Mouretia is close to the place where the muscular impression is
  interrupted to leave a space for the head; while in Siphonaria it is
  nearly half way between the anterior and posterior ends of the shell.</p>

  <p>MOUTH. The aperture or opening of univalve shells.</p>

  <p>MULINIA. Gray. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Mactra</span>, Auct. described as having the ligament
  (properly so called) internal, and lateral teeth simple. <i>Ex.</i> fig.
  82. M. bicolor; Mactra, Auct.</p>

  <p>MULLERIA. Fer. <i>Fam.</i> Ostracea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Irregular, subquadrate, inequivalve, inequilateral, foliaceous, attached,
  pearly within, green, horny without; hinge irregular, with a partly
  external ligament, passing to the interior, through a sort of
  sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This remarkable shell resembles Etheria in
  general form and appearance, but is distinguished by having only one
  muscular impression. It is so rare that, although not very beautiful, a
  specimen has been known to produce £20. at a sale. Fig. 192.</p>

  <p>MULTILOCULAR. Many chambered.</p>

  <p>MULTISPIRAL. (<i>Multus</i>, many, <i>spira</i>, spire.) A term
  applied to a shell when the spire consists of numerous whorls; or to an
  operculum of numerous volutions.</p>

  <p>MULTIVALVE. (<i>Multus</i>, many; <i>valva</i>, valve.) Consisting of
  numerous valves. There are three kinds of multivalve shells: 1st. Those
  in which the valves are arranged in pairs, and produce a flattened
  figure, as Pedunculated Cirripedes, fig. 34 to 43; 2nd. Those in which
  they are arranged circularly, as Sessile Cirripedes, the valves of which
  are of two kinds; the <i>opercular</i>, consisting of several valves,
  which close the aperture, and the <i>parietal</i>, consisting of those
  which surround the body of the animal in a circular form, fig. 14 to 33.
  3rd. Those in which they are arranged in a straight line, as Chiton, fig.
  227.</p>

  <p>MUREX. Auct. (<i>A sharp rock.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam.
  siphonostoma, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turrited, ventricose, thick, with
  three or more longitudinal, continuous, branched, spinose or fringed
  varices; spire prominent, acute; aperture oval, terminating in a
  posterior, partly closed canal, outer lip varicose, inner lip smooth,
  laminar; operculum horny, concentric, pointed.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This
  genus contains some of the most exquisitely beautiful shells in
  existence, the richness of their colouring, the ramifications of their
  varices, would render most species the finest possible subject for the
  exercise of the painter's art in still life. The most remarkable are the
  Rosebud Murex, with its pink-tipt fringes, the Venus Comb, with its long
  rows of parallel spines; the Ducal Murex, the Royal Murex, and many
  others, which are much sought after by collectors. Murex may be
  distinguished from Triton by the continuity of the varices, which follow
  each other in a tortuous direction on the spire. The Ranellæ have only
  two rows of varices, and have a posterior as well as anterior canal;
  while Murices have three or more varices, and only one canal. The genus
  Typhis consists of several small species resembling Murex in every
  respect, excepting that of having a tubular opening on the upper part of
  the whorl between each varix. See <span class="sc">Typhis</span>. The
  most beautiful Murices are brought from tropical climates. Fig. 395,
  396.</p>

  <p>MURICANTHUS. Sw. A sub-genus of Murex, thus described: "Varices
  numerous, foliated; spire short; margin of the outer lip with a prominent
  tooth near the base; Radix. <i>Sw.</i> Zool. Ill. 2nd series. pl. 113,
  Melanomathus. En. Méth. 418. f. 2." Sw. p. 296. The latter of the two
  species quoted, however, does not agree with the description, having no
  prominent tooth on the margin of the outer lip.</p>

  <p>MURICATED. (<i>Muricatus.</i>) Having sharp points or prickles.</p>

  <p>MURICIDEA. Sw. A genus of "Muricinæ," Sw. thus described, "Spire more
  produced, as long or longer than the body whorl; varices numerous; no
  internal channel at the top of the aperture." Sw. p. 297, and consisting
  of the following incongruous species, "Lamellosa. Chem. f. 1823, 4.
  magellanica. En. M. 419. f. 4. peruviana. Ib. f. 5. senticosa, Ib. f. 3.

  <p>MUSCULAR IMPRESSIONS are the marks or areas formed on the interior
  surface of shells by the muscular fibres which attach the animals to
  them. Lamarck has divided his Conchifera into two kinds: 1st. Monomyaria,
  those which have but one adductor muscle, and consequently have but one
  impression in each valve, as the common Oyster, fig. 180; 2nd. The
  Dimyaria, those which have two, and consequently have two impressions in
  each valve. There are other smaller impressions in some shells besides
  the principal. The palleal impression is a mark or scar passing near the
  margin of the shell. See Introduction.</p>

  <p>MYA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Myaria, Lam. Pyloridea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Transverse, oval, thick, gaping at both extremities, rounded anteriorly,
  acuminated posteriorly; hinge with one large, dilate, compressed tooth in
  one valve, and a suture in the other, containing the cartilage; muscular
  impressions two, distant, large, irregular; palleal impression with a
  large sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Mya may be known by the large, prominent,
  broad tooth in one valve. In Anatina there is one in each valve, and, in
  Lyonsia, accessory pieces. Lutraria has cardinal teeth and a ligamentary
  pit. Few species of Mya are known. They belong to the Northern
  Hemisphere. M. truncata, fig. 71.</p>

  <p>MYCETOPODA or MYCETOPUS. D'Orb. <i>Fam.</i> Nayades,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Shell elongated, soleniform, inequivalve,

  appendage is placed; external surface of both valves conforming to the
  grooves or undulations of the shell to which the specimen is attached;
  muscular impressions two in each valve; palleal impressions with a short
  sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This new genus, of which only one species is
  known, the M. anomioides from New South Wales, differs from Anomia and
  Anatina in being attached by the surface of one of the valves, from which
  circumstance the word Chama is added to its name; the little testaceous
  appendage bringing it near the Myariæ. Fig. 73, M. anomioides.</p>

  <p>MYOCONCHA. Sow. (<i>Mya</i> and <i>Concha</i>.) <i>Fam.</i> Cardiacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval, equivalve, oblique; umbones terminal;
  ventral margin rounded; hinge with an external ligament, and one oblique,
  elongated tooth in the left valve; impression of the mantle not
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The fossil genus has the general form of
  Mytilus or Modiola, but the hinge of the Conchæ generally.</p>

  <p>MYOPARA. Lea. (<i>Myoparo</i>, a piratical oar-galley.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Arcacea, Lam. A genus founded on a minute fossil bivalve shell, somewhat
  resembling Isocardia in form, but having a series of teeth placed on each
  side of the umbones. M. costatus, fig. 135.</p>

  <p>MYRISTICA. Sw. A genus of "Pyrulinæ," Sw. thus described:
  "Sub-pyriform; spire strong, spiny, or tuberculated, nearly as long as
  the base; umbilicus either partially or entirely concealed; inner lip
  vitreous, thin; the outer with an internal and ascending canal; the basal
  channel wide. Hippocastanea. En. M. 432. f. 4. lineata, Ib. f. 5.
  melongena. En. Méth. 435. f. 3. nodosa. Chem. 1564. 5." Sw. p. 307.

  <p>MYRTEA. Turt. <span class="sc">Venus</span> spinifera, Auct. <span
  class="sc">Lucina</span> spinifera, Nonnull. The shells of this genus are
  described as "Oval, triangular, equivalve, nearly equilateral, closed.
  Hinge of one valve with a single tooth, and lateral one on each side; of
  the other valve with two teeth, the lateral ones obscure. Ligament
  external." British Channel and Mediterranean.</p>

  <p>MYSCA. Turt. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Unio</span>, Auct. which are distinguished by having "strong,
  transverse, notched, cardinal and long lateral teeth." Unio pictorum.</p>

  <p>MYSIA. Leach. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Tellina</span>
  rotundata, montagu and other similar species.</p>

  <p>MYTILACEA. Bl. The fourth family of Lamellibranchiata, Bl. The shells
  are described as regular, equivalve, frequently with a thick, horny
  epidermis. A toothless hinge and a linear ligament. This family contains
  the genera Mytilus and Pinna.</p>

  <p>MYTILACEA. Lam. A family belonging to the first section of Conchifera
  Monomyaria, Lam. described as having the ligament partly interior,
  occupying the greater part of the hinge line, which is straight. The
  shell is rarely foliaceous. The Mytilaceæ cannot easily be confounded
  with the Malleaceæ, because the former are generally regular and the
  latter are irregular, and have a thick internal coating of pearl, beyond
  which the external coating extends. The genera may be thus
  distinguished:</p>

  <p>NASSA. Lam. A genus of small shells united to Buccinum by some
  authors, but separated by others on account of the little tooth-like
  projection terminating the columella. N. arcularia, fig. 423.</p>

  <p>NATICA. Brug. <i>Fam.</i> Neritacea, Lam. Hemicyclostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Globose, thick, generally smooth; spire short,
  pointed, with few volutions; aperture semilunar, entire; outer lip thin;
  columellar lip oblique, nearly straight, callous; umbilicus with a spiral
  callosity, terminating behind the columella, and sometimes filling up the
  cavity; operculum shelly in some species, horny in others; epidermis
  thin, light, semitransparent.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The straight, callous,
  smooth edge of the columella and the callosity serve to distinguish this
  genus from Nerita, Neritina, Neritopsis and Helix. Fig. 327, 328.</p>

  <p>NATICARIA. Sw. A sub-genus of Natica, thus described: "Oval; convex
  above; umbilicus small, open, placed very near the top of the aperture;
  inner lip reflected; small. N. melanostoma, Mart. 189. f. 1926, 1927.

  <p>NAVICELLA. Lam. (<i>A little ship.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Neritacea, Lam.
  Hemicyclostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Transversely oval, symmetrical,
  smooth; aperture entire, oval; dorsal surface convex; outer lip thin;
  inner lip flat, straight edged; spread over the front surface of the body
  whorl, and sometimes hiding the apex; apex incurved; operculum
  testaceous, flat, sub-quadrate, with a lateral
  articulation.&mdash;<i>Obs</i>. This well known genus, of which there are
  several species, is named Cimber by Montfort. The shells are brought from
  India, the Isle of France and the Moluccas. Fig. 323, N. elliptica.</p>

  <p>NAUTELLIPSITES. Parkinson. A generic name proposed to include such
  species of Nautilus as have been compressed, so as to assume an oval
  instead of a round form. The genus Ellipsolites of De Montfort consists
  of species of Ammonites similarly deformed.</p>

  <p>NAUTILACEA. Bl. The fifth family of Polythalamacea, Bl. the shells of
  which are described as more or less discoidal, compressed, symmetrically
  convolute; the last whorl much longer than the others; which are entirely
  hidden beneath it and advancing beyond the last but one, so as constantly
  to form a large oval aperture, which is always, however, modified by the
  last whorl. The septa are united in the greater number of instances and
  pierced by one or more (?) siphons. This family contains the genera
  Orbulites, Nautilus, Polystomella and Lenticulina.</p>

  <p>NAUTILACEA. Lam. The sixth family of Polythalamous Cephalopoda, Lam.
  containing the genera Discorbites, Siderolites, Polystomella,
  Vorticialis, Nummulites, Nautilus. To these may be added Simplegas and
  Endosiphonites. Fig. 472 to 476.</p>

  <p>NAUTILUS. Auct. (<i>A little boat.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Nautilacea, Lam.
  and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Convolute, discoid, chambered, symmetrical;
  spire partly or entirely concealed by the last whorl; aperture modified
  by the last whorl, wide, sinuated on the dorsal margin; interior surface
  pearly; septa dividing the chambers simple; siphon
  discontinuous.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shell named Nautilus by Pliny is the
  Argonauta of modern authors, a thin shell, not chambered. The Nautili are
  known from the Ammonites by the septa being simple, not sinuated as in
  the latter genus, and in general the volutions of the spire are not
  visible. Three or four species are known inhabitants of the Pacific Ocean
  and Australian Ocean. The fossil species are found in the tertiary, and
  also in the secondary strata, as low down as the Mountain limestone. N.
  pompilius, Frontispiece.</p>

  <p>NAYADES. Lam. A family of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam.
  described as containing fresh-water bivalve shells, with or without teeth
  on the hinge. They are all pearly within, and have a thick, rather smooth
  epidermis without. This family contains a great variety of shells, which
  have been separated into an immense number of genera, but which G. B.
  Sowerby, sen. gives very good reasons for uniting under one generic name.
  The most generally received distinctions are as follows:</p>

  <p>NEMATOPODA. Bl. The first class of the sub-type Malentozoa, Bl.
  containing all the mollusca with multivalve shells, except Chiton, and
  divided into the families Lepadicea and Balanidea, corresponding with

  Lepas.</p>

  <p>NEMATURA. Benson. <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Thin, nearly oval, somewhat compressed from back to front; spire acute,

  the aperture; aperture small, oblique, rounded anteriorly; peritreme
  continuous, thin; operculum spiral, horny, with few
  volutions.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The distinguishing character of this genus
  is the contraction of the last whorl near the aperture, in which respect
  it is nearly resembled by the shell called Cyclostoma lucidum. Two recent
  and one fossil species, all very minute, are described by Sowerby in
  Loudon's Magazine of Natural History, New Series. Fig. 305.</p>

  <p>NERINEA. Defr. <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>

  one on the inner lip at the edge of the body whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus is only found in a fossil state usually in the Oolitic beds,
  it is not resembled by any other; the strong, prominent folds on the
  three upper angles of the subquadrate aperture present a singular
  appearance in a section. One species has been named N. Hieroglyphus. We

  outer lip thick, entire; inner lip thickened, dentated at the edge,
  spread over the body whorl, forming a flattened disc; operculum shelly,
  spiral, with an appendage by which it is locked under the sharp edge of
  the columella.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> These marine shells are known from
  Neritina by the thickness of the shell and the want of the thick, horny,
  dark coloured epidermis; from Natica by the flat area produced by the
  spreading of the thickened columellar lip. N. Peloronta, fig. 330. N.

  author's Conchological Illustrations, parts 86, 87, 90, 91, 94 to 100.
  The catalogue accompanying these representations enumerates 59
  species.</p>

  <p>NERITOPSIS. Gray. <i>Fam.</i> Neritacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Sub-globose, thick, cancellated; spire short, composed of few rapidly
  increasing whorls; aperture transverse, sub-orbicular; outer lip
  thickened within; columellar lip thick, rather flat, with a large rounded
  notch in the centre of its inner edge.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus most
  nearly resembles Nerita, from which it differs in the peculiar notch of
  the columella. N. granosa, fig. 331.</p>

  <p>NICANIA. Leach. <span class="sc">Astarte</span>, Sowerby. The same as
  <span class="sc">Crassina</span> of Lamarck.</p>

  <p>NITIDELLA. Sw. A genus of "Columbellinæ," Sw. thus described:
  "Bucciniform, small, ovate, smooth, glassy; aperture effuse; outer lip
  slightly thickened, faintly inflexed, and generally striated internally;
  inner lip somewhat flattened above; base of the pillar with one or two
  slight internal folds, or a single angular projection. Columbella nitida,
  <i>Lam.</i> (fig. 17, <i>c.</i> p. 151.)" Sw. p. 313.</p>

  <p>NOBIA. Leach. <i>Order</i>, Sessile Cirripedes, Lam. This genus
  resembles Pyrgoma, Auct. consisting of a conical paries, supported upon a
  funnel-shaped cavity in the madrepore, but differs in its operculum,
  which consists of two valves, whereas that of Pyrgoma has four. N.
  grandis, fig. 29.</p>

  <p>NODOSARIA. Lam. and <span class="sc">Orthocera</span> have been united
  by Sowerby under the name of the first. <i>Fam.</i> Orthocerata, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Straight, chambered, elongated; chambers more or
  less ventricose; septa perforated by a central siphon.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus consists only of fossils found in sub-appenine tertiary beds.
  It is placed by De Blainville in one of his divisions of the genus
  Orthoceras, which is characterized as "species not striated, and with
  chambers very much inflated." N. æqualis, fig. 465.</p>

  <p>NODOSE. Having tubercles or knobs.</p>

  <p>NOGROBS. Montf. A fossil appearing from the figure and description to
  resemble Belemnites.</p>

  <p>NONION. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>NONIONINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>NOTREMA. Rafinesque. A shell described as composed of three integral
  valves, concerning which De Blainville puts the query, "ne seroit-ce pas
  plutôt une Balanide mal observée?"</p>

  <p>NOVACULINA. Benson. (<i>Novacula</i>, a razor.) <i>Fam.</i> Solenacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, transversely
  elongated; external ligament communicating with the interior of the shell
  by an oblique channel; beaks prominent; hinge line nearly straight, with
  one narrow curved cardinal tooth in one valve, entering between two
  similar teeth in the other; siphonal scar long; extremities of the shell
  gaping; epidermis thin, light brown, folding over the edges and
  connecting the dorsal margins. <i>Hab.</i> Jumna, Gooti, and Ganges. Fig.
  63.</p>

  <p>NUCLEOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The fifth order of the second section of
  Paracephalophora Monoica, Bl. the shells of which are described as
  symmetrical, more or less curved, or longitudinally rolled up and very
  thin. This order contains, <i>Fam.</i> 1. Nectopoda, containing
  Carinaria; <i>Fam.</i> 2. Pteropoda, containing Atlanta, Spiratella and
  Argonauta.</p>

  <p>NUCLEUS. (<i>A kernel.</i>) Anything forming a centre around which
  matter is gathered. The nucleus of shells is the first formed part; the
  first deposit of shelly matter to which the successive layers are added;
  the apex of the spiral cone, of which most shells are composed. (See
  <span class="sc">Cone</span>.) The nucleus is formed within the egg in
  oviparous, and within the old shell in viviparous mollusca. It is
  frequently more transparent and light than the remainder of the shell,
  and sometimes falls off; when this occurs the shell is said to be
  decollated.</p>

  <p>NUCULA. Lam. (<i>A small nut.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Arcacea, Bl. and
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, covered
  with an epidermis; hinge linear, with a series of sharp, angulated teeth,
  arranged in a line on each side of the umbones, and a central ligamentary
  pit; muscular impressions two, simple; palleal impressions not
  sinuated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The row of teeth on each side of the umbones,
  and the ligamentary pit in the centre of the hinge prevent the pretty
  little shells of this genus from being confounded with any other.
  Thirty-four figures are enumerated in the catalogue by Sowerby, sen.
  which accompanies the Conchological Illustrations of the author. The new
  species, to the amount of 24, have been figured in parts 14 to 16, of the
  above mentioned work. Recent Nuculæ are found from the frozen to the
  torrid zones, and the fossil species occur in nearly all the beds from
  the Pliocene to the Carboniferous system.</p>

  <p>NUMMULACEA. Bl. The third family of Cellulacea, Bl. described as
  containing shells or calcareous bodies, which are characterized as
  discoidal, lenticular; without the slightest traces of whorls to be seen
  externally. The whorls are numerous, internal, and divided into a great
  number of cells, which are separated from each other by imperforate
  septa. This family contains the genera Nummulites, Siderolites,
  Vorticialis, Helicites, Orbiculina, Placentula.</p>

  <p>NUMMULTTES. Lam. (<i>Nummus</i>, money.) <i>Fam.</i> Nautilacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Orbicular, convolute, shewing no trace of spire
  externally; interior divided into cells spirally
  arranged.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The singular fossils composing this genus
  receive their name from their external resemblance to a battered coin.

  <p>OBELISCUS. Humph. <span class="sc">Trochus</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>OBLIQUE. (<i>obliquus.</i> lat.) In a slanting direction. The whorls
  of spiral univalves generally take an oblique direction in reference to
  the imaginary axis of the shell. A bivalve is said to be oblique when it
  slants off from the umbones. An example of this is seen in Avicula, fig.
  163.</p>

  <p>OBSOLETE. (<i>obsoletus</i>, lat.) Worn out, out of use. This term is
  used to express an indistinctness of character, which sometimes results
  from the action of sea-water upon unprotected parts of the shell, and

  present a great variety of rich markings and brilliant colours. They are
  marine and tropical. Fossil species are found sparingly in the London
  Clay and Calcaire-grossièr. The Ancillariæ are distinguished from this
  genus by the sutures of the whorls being covered by enamel. O. maura,
  fig. 457.</p>

  <p>OLIVELLA. Sw. A genus of "Olivinæ," Sw. thus described: "Oliviform;
  spire (typically) rather produced; the tip acute; inner lip not
  thickened; outer lip straight; base of the pillar curved inwards, and
  marked by two strong plaits; upper plaits obsolete or wanting; aperture
  effused at the base only; biplicata, Tank. Cat. 2332. purpurata. Zool.

  <p>ONISCIA. Sow. (G. B.) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam. Entomostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oblong, sub-ovate, slightly turbinated,
  cancellated; spire short; aperture elongated; terminating anteriorly in a
  very short, recurved canal; outer lip thickened, denticulated within;
  inner lip spread over a portion of the body whorl,
  granulated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The granulated inner lip is the principal
  character by which this genus is distinguished from Cassidaria. In
  Oniscia the canal is not so produced. O. oniscus, fig. 409.</p>

  <p>ONUSTUS. Humph. A genus proposed by Humphrey and adopted by Swainson
  who describes it thus: "Shell trochiform; the surface irregular, and
  often covered with extraneous bodies, cemented and incorporated with the
  calcareous substance of the shell; the under part of the body whorl
  flattened or concave, umbilicate. O. Solaris. Mart. 173. f. 1700, 1701.
  Indicus. Ib. 172. f. 1697. 1698." It is probable, from the above
  description, that Mr. Swainson intended to include Trochus agglutinans of
  authors. (Genus Phorus, Montf.) Fig. 360.</p>

  <p>OPERCULAR. Of, or belonging to, the operculum. A term applied to the
  valves which compose the operculum of multivalve shells, as distinguished
  from the parietal valves, or those which are arranged circularly and form
  the body of the shell.</p>

  <p>OPERCULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>OPERCULUM. (<i>A cover or lid.</i>) The plate or plates with which
  many molluscous animals enclose the aperture of their shells, when
  retired within them. The operculum is sometimes horny, as in Trochus;
  testaceous or shelly, as in Turbo. It is spiral when from a central or
  sub-central nucleus, the successive layers take a revolving direction, as
  in Trochus. It is concentric or annular when the outside edge of each
  layer entirely surrounds the preceding one. It is unguiculated, when the
  laminæ are placed side by side, as in Purpura. The opercula of multivalve
  shells are composed of two or four pieces, which are called the opercular
  valves. The shelly or membranaceous plate with which some of the animals
  enclose the aperture of their shells, during the wintry part of the year,
  for the purpose of protecting them while in a torpid state, and which
  they get rid of by dissolving the edges, when preparing to emerge from
  their temporary retirement, must not be considered as the operculum, as
  it does not belong to or form part of either the animal or its shell, but
  is produced for the occasion by a secretion of the animal, being
  deposited in a soft state and subsequently hardening. It is called the
  epiphragm, and may easily be distinguished from the true operculum by the
  texture, and by the circumstance of their being soldered to the edge of
  the aperture. The operculum, on the contrary, is moveable, and is always
  composed of a series of successive layers, corresponding with the growth
  of the shell.</p>

  <p>OPIS. Defr. A genus described by De Blainville as consisting of
  species of Trigonia which have the umbones sub-spiral, with a large,
  striated tooth on the hinge. Opis cardissoides, Trigonia, Lam. Opis
  similis, Sow. Min. Con. pl. 232. f. 2.</p>

  <p>ORAL. (<i>Os</i>, <i>oris</i>, mouth.) Applied to that part of a shell
  which corresponds with the mouth of the animal, but very seldom used in
  this sense.</p>

  <p>ORBICULA. Lam. (<i>Orbis</i>, an orb.) <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda, Lam.
  Palliobranchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve, irregular,
  sub-orbicular, compressed, attached by a fibrous substance passing
  through a fissure near the centre of the lower valve; upper valve
  patelliform, with the umbo central; muscular impressions four in each
  valve, semilunar. South America and West Indies.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  Discina, Lam. is an Orbicula. Crania is known from this genus by having
  no fissure in the lower valve, but being attached by its substance.
  Hipponyx has only two muscular impressions in each valve. O. lævis, fig.
  201.</p>

  <p>ORBICULAR. (<i>Orbiculus</i>, a little orb.) Of a round or circular
  form.</p>

  <p>ORBICULINA. Lam. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>ORBIS. Lea. A minute fossil, described as "orbicular, with flat
  quadrate whorls and aperture square," in other respects resembling
  Solarium. O. Rotella, fig. 355, 356.</p>

  <p>ORBITINA. Risso. A genus said to be established upon the nuclei of two
  land shells.</p>

  <p>ORBULITES. Lam. A genus separated from Ammonites on account of the
  last volution covering the spire. This is generally considered as
  characterizing the Nautili, and distinguishing them from the Ammonites;
  but there are so many gradations that it seems impossible to maintain the
  distinction in this respect. Fig. 479, O. crassus, fig. 480, O.
  discus.</p>

  <p>OREAS. Montf. Part of <span class="sc">Cristellaria</span>, Lam. A

  <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda, Lam. One of the generic divisions of Brachiopoda
  by Dalman, thus described: "Hinge rectilinear, with umbones distant; the
  larger valve with a transverse, basal, smooth area, with a triangular
  pit." O. basalis, fig. 207.</p>

  <p>ORTHOCERA. Lam. See <span class="sc">Nodosaria</span>.</p>

  Ostracea and the Pectinides consists in the absence of the auricles and
  the foliated structure of the shells, for, although the Spondylus has
  ex-foliations or spines upon the external surface, the shell itself is
  compact and firm. This family contains the genera Gryphæa, Ostrea,

  Irregular, inequivalve, generally inequilateral, foliaceous, attached by
  part of the lower valve; hinge sometimes slightly crenated; destitute of
  teeth; with the ligament spread upon the lower part of a central,
  triangular area, which is divided into three parts; upper valve much

  different from each other that, without any desire to increase the number
  of genera, it was found necessary by subsequent authors to separate them.
  The common Oyster is the type of this genus as at present constituted,
  and is well known to be abundant in various parts of the world. Those
  which depart furthest from this type are the Gryphæa, Lam. with a
  prominent, incurved umbo in the lower valve. The Dendostrea, Sw. with
  margins characterized by strongly angulated folds, throws out arms from
  the lower valve, by which they are attached to stems of sea-weed, &amp;c.

  <p>OXYSTOMATA. Bl. The fifth family of Asiphonibranchiata, Bl. This
  family appears to have been formed for the express purpose of providing a
  place in the system for the genus Janthina, which seems to bear so little
  analogy with other genera of Mollusca, that conchological writers have
  been puzzled to know where to place it.</p>

  <p>PACHYLABRA. Sw. <span class="sc">Pachystoma</span>, Guild. A sub-genus
  of Ampullaria, the outer lip of which is thickened within. <i>Ex.</i>
  Ampullaria globosa.</p>

  <p>PACHYMYA. Sow. (<span title="pachus" class="grk"

  >&pi;&alpha;&chi;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>pachus</i>, thick; <span
  title="stoma" class="grk">&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span>,
  <i>stoma</i>, mouth.) A genus composed of such species of Ampullaria,
  Auct. as have the edge of the aperture thickened and grooved within so as
  to form a sort of ledge upon which the operculum rests. Ampullaria
  globosa and corrugata are examples of this variation. The name Pachylabra
  is given to such species by Swainson, who objects to the above name on
  account of its having been previously used to a genus of fishes. Fig.
  539.</p>

  <p>PACHYTOMA. Sw. A sub-genus of Helicina, thus described, "Aperture
  entire; the inner lip very thick; the spiral whorls hardly convex; P.
  occidentalis. Zool. J. iii. 15. f. 6-10. viridis, Zool. Journ. i. pl. 6.
  f. 7." Sw. p. 337.</p>

  <p>PACLITES. Montf. A genus composed of species of Belemnites, Auct.

  lengthened aperture. <i>Ex.</i> B. ungulatus, Bl.</p>

  <p>PADOLLUS. Montf. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Haliotis</span>, with a strongly marked spiral groove.
  <i>Ex.</i> H. tricostalis, Lam. Fig. 339.</p>

  <p>PAGODELLA. Sw. A sub-genus of Trochus, thus described: "Trochiform;
  generally thin, and always not pearlaceous; aperture and pillar perfectly
  united and entire; operculum horny. P. major. Mart. 163. f. 1541, 1542.
  tectum-persicum. Ib. f. 1543, 1544." Sw. p. 351.</p>

  <p>PALLEAL IMPRESSION. (<i>Pallium</i>, a mantle.) The mark or groove
  formed in a bivalve shell by the muscular attachment of the mantle,
  which, being always found near the margin of the shell, is sometimes
  termed the marginal impression. In bivalves with two muscular impressions
  it passes from one to the other. If in passing, it takes a bend inwards
  posteriorly, it is said to be sinuated, and that part is called by Mr.
  Gray, the Siphonal scar.</p>

  <p>PALLIOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The first order of the class Acephalophora. Bl.
  The animals of this order are described as more or less compressed,
  included between the two valves of a bivalve shell, one inferior, the
  other superior, joining at the back and opening in front. The
  Palliobranchiata in the system of De Blainville correspond with the
  Brachiopoda in the system of Lamarck, and the shells may be known by
  their being symmetrical. This order contains in the first section of
  symmetrical bivalves, Lingula, Terebratula, Thecidium, Strophomena,
  Plagiostoma, Dianchora and Podopsis: in the second section, Orbicula and
  Crania.</p>

  <p>PALMATED. Flattened like a palm, as the fronds or fringes of some
  Murices.</p>

  <p>PALMINA. Gray. Differing from <span class="sc">Otion</span> in having
  but one auricle.</p>

  <p>PALUDINA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Peristomata, Lam. Cricostomata,
  Bl&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Varying in form from oval to globose, in some
  instances oblong, covered with a greenish horny epidermis; spire acute,
  composed of rounded whorls; aperture ovate; peritreme entire, slightly
  modified by the last whorl; operculum horny, concentric. Europe, North
  America, East Indies, China, &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The construction
  of the operculum distinguishes this genus of freshwater shells from
  Valvata and Cyclostoma. The Paludinæ are viviparous. Fig. 321. P.
  Achatina.</p>

  <p>PALUDOMUS. Sw. A genus of the family of "Melanianæ," Sw. described as
  differing from Melania in having the spire shorter than the aperture. Sw.
  p. 340.</p>

  <p>PANDORA. Brug. <i>Fam.</i> Corbulacea, Lam. Pyloridea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, inequivalve, pearly within, rounded
  anteriorly, rostrated posteriorly; right valve flat with a cardinal
  tooth, or short rib, and a slit containing the cartilage with a narrow
  plate on the dorsal edge turned towards the left valve; left valve
  concave, with a receptacle for the cardinal tooth of the right valve and
  the internal cartilage; no external ligament. Europe, America, Ceylon,
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This well known genus is in no danger of being
  confounded with any other shell. Fig. 90. P. rostrata.</p>

  <p>PANOPÆA. Menard. <i>Fam.</i> Solenacea, Lam. Pyloridea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, oval, gaping at both
  extremities; hinge with an acute cardinal tooth in each valve, and a
  large callosity near the umbones supporting the ligament; muscular
  impressions two, distant, oval; palleal impression with a large sinus.
  Britain, North America, Mediterranean, Australia,
  &amp;c.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus resembles Mya in general appearance,
  but differs in having an external ligament and a sharp tooth, instead of
  the broad spoon-shaped process in the hinge of the latter genus. Fig. 65.
  P. Australis.</p>

  <p>PAPER SAILOR. A common name given to the Argonauta.</p>

  <p>PAPILLARY. (<i>Papilla</i>, a teat.) Shaped like a teat. This term is
  applied by conchologists when the apex of the spire of an univalve shell
  is rounded like a teat and not spiral up to the extreme point; as the
  apex of Cymba, fig. 434.</p>

  <p>PAPYRACEOUS. (<i>Papyrus</i>, a kind of paper made of the flags of the
  river Nile in Egypt.) Of a thin, light texture, resembling that of paper.
  An example of this is to be seen in the Argonauta, commonly called the
  "Paper Sailor," fig. 485, and in the Pholas papyracea, fig. 56.</p>

  <p>PAPYRIDEA. Sw. A sub-genus of Cardium, thus described; "Shell
  heart-shaped, or transversely oval; inequilateral; the anterior side
  almost always gaping; representing the Pholidæ. P. Soleniforme, Wood,
  Conch. pl. 56. f. 3.&mdash;apertum, Ib. 56. f. 2.&mdash;transversum, Sow.

  <p>PARACEPHALOPHORA. Bl. The second class of the type Malacozoa, Bl.
  divided into the sub-classes: P. dioica, P. monoica, P.
  hermaphrodita.</p>

  <p>PARIES. (<i>A wall.</i>) The principal part of a multivalve shell,
  forming a circular wall round the body of the animal, and composed of one
  or more valves which are called the parietal valves.</p>

  <p>PARIETAL VALVES. The principal valves of multivalve shells surrounding
  the body like a wall; as distinguished from the opercular valves, or
  those which compose the operculum.</p>

  <p>PARMACELLA. Cuv. (<i>A little cell.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Limacinea, Lam.
  and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Haliotoid, internal, thin; spire flat,
  consisting of one or two rapidly increasing whorls; aperture as large as
  the whole shell, with the dorsal margins inflected.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This description applies to Parmacella of Cuvier. The shell figured in
  Sowerby's Genera under that name is Cryptella of Webb. Fig. 257, P.
  Olivieri. Fig. 258, P. Palliolum.</p>

  <p>PARMOPHORUS. Bl. A genus composed of <span
  class="sc">Emarginula</span> elongata, Auct. and other species of a
  similarly elongated form. Australian. Fig. 242. P. elongatus.</p>

  <p>PARTULA. Fer. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam. Auriculacea,
  Fer.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Conical, smooth; spire equal to the aperture in
  length, consisting of few whorls; aperture auriform; outer lip reflected,
  broad; inner lip reflected, with a slight prominence on the columella. P.
  australis, fig. 302.</p>

  <p>PASITHÆA. Lea. A genus formed of some pyramidal shells, described as
  resembling Melania, but separated from that genus on account of being
  marine fossils. Fig. 317, P. striata.</p>

  <p>PATELLA. Auct. (<i>A dish</i> or <i>platter</i>.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Phyllidiana, Lam. Retifera, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Symmetrical,
  compresso-conical, nearly regular, oblong or oval; apex sub-central,
  inclining towards the anterior margin; aperture oval, forming the base of
  the shell; internal surface smooth; with a muscular impression shaped
  like a horse-shoe, with the ends bending forwards, encircling and
  dividing the space all round, except where the interruption occurs to
  receive the head of the animal; external surface ribbed, grooved,
  striated or banded radiately. On rocks and sea-weeds in all
  climates.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Patelloida differs from Patella in the
  construction of the animal; Siphonaria, in the lateral siphon; and
  Ancylus, in the oblique twist of the axis, as well as in the nature of
  the animal. The Patellæ are marine. Fig. 229, P. Oculus.</p>

  <p>PATELLIFORM. (<i>Patella</i>, a dish; <i>forma</i>, shape.) Shaped
  like a dish, or like shells of the genus Patella.</p>

  <p>PATELLOIDA. Quoy and Gaimard. <span class="sc">Lottia</span>,
  Gray.&mdash;<i>Fam.</i> Phyllidiana, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Patelliform, rather flat; apex obtuse, leaning towards the posterior
  margin; muscular impression not symmetrical, but widest on the right side
  near the head of the animal; central disc of a variable brown colour. On
  rocks and sea-weeds in all climates.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells of this
  genus so closely resemble Patella that it is almost impossible to make
  the distinction from the shells alone. They are, however, generally
  flatter, and have the apex placed somewhat nearer the posterior margin.
  The animals are very distinct. Fig. 231, P. Antillarum.</p>

  <p>PATELLOIDEA, Bl. or patelliform shells. The third family of the order
  Monopleurobranchiata, Bl.; the animals of which are described as
  depressed, flattened, covered by a wide external shell, which is
  patelliform and non-symmetrical. This family contains the genera Umbrella
  and Siphonaria.</p>

  <p>PATROCLES. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>PATULARIA. Sw. A sub-genus of "Anodontinæ," Sw. thus described: "Shell
  nearly equilateral, round or cordate; no teeth. P. ovata, Sw." <i>Ex.</i>
  <i>Conch.</i> pl. 36. rotundatus, Ib. pl. 137.</p>

  <p>PAVONIA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>PECTEN. Brug. (<i>A comb.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Pectenides, Lam.
  Subostracea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve, ribbed longitudinally,
  nearly equilateral, with a triangular auricle on each side of the
  umbones; hinge linear, destitute of teeth, having a central pit
  containing the cartilage; muscular impressions one in each valve, large,
  sub-central.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of beautiful shells, to which
  the well known Scallop belongs, contains numerous species, some of which
  are found in the British Seas. The Hinnites Pusio (P. Pusio of some
  authors) has been separated on account of the irregularity of the
  external surface of one valve. Fig. 171 to 173.</p>

  <p>PECTENIDES. Lam. A family belonging to the second section of the order
  Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam. including the following genera.</p>

  <p>PECTINATED. (<i>Pecten</i>, a comb.) Marked in a regular series of
  ridges.</p>

  <p>PECTUNCULUS. (<i>Pecten</i>, dim.) <i>Fam.</i> Arcacea, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, sub-equilateral, orbicular, thick,
  covered with a velvety epidermis, striated longitudinally; ventral margin
  denticulated within; hinge semi-circular, with a series of small teeth on
  each side of the umbones, which are separated by a small triangular disc
  in each valve bearing the ligament; muscular impressions two in each
  valve, strongly marked, united by an entire palleal
  impression.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Linnæan conchologists have mixed this genus
  with Arca, from which it is, however, totally distinct, not only in the
  roundness of the general form, but also, and principally, in the curve of
  the hinge line; in fact the characters of this genus are so strongly
  marked that there is no danger of confounding it with any other. It does
  not contain many species; two or three are British. The fossil species
  occur in London Clay and Calcaire-grossiér. Fig. 134, P. pilosus.</p>

  <p>PEDICLE or PEDUNCLE. (<i>Pedunculus</i>, a little foot.) The stem or
  organ of attachment of the class of shells called in the system of
  Lamarck "Pedunculated Cirripedes," consisting of a fleshy tendinous tube,
  by the lower end of which they are attached to sub-marine substances.</p>

  <p>PEDICULARIA. Sw. A genus of "Scutibranchia," thus described: "Shell
  irregular, sub-patelliform; a thick, large, obsolete apex on one of the
  longest sides, and an internal callous rim within, on one side only;
  circumference undulated, irregular. P. Sicula, Sw." Sw. p. 357. Sicily. A
  singular shell of the nature of Calyptræa, which is found attached to
  corals, conforming its shape to the irregularity of their surface, and
  fitting closely. <i>Ex.</i> Fig. 513.</p>

  <p>PEDIPES. Adanson. <i>Fam.</i> Auriculacea, Bl. Colimacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-globose, longitudinal, thick, striated;
  spire equal to the aperture in length; aperture sub-ovate; peritreme
  sharp, thickened within, modified by the last whorl; columella with three
  strong plaits on the inner edge; outer lip with one
  fold.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus contains but one or two small recent
  species, which in some respects resemble Auricula, from which it is known
  by the thickness of its shell, and its globular form. Fig. 299, P.
  Adansoni. Coast of Africa.</p>

  <p>PEDUM. Lam. (<i>A shepherd's crook.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Pectinides, Lam.
  Sub-ostracea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Irregular, inequivalve,
  sub-equilateral, attached by a byssus passing through a sinus in the
  lower valve; hinge toothless, with a triangular area in each valve,
  separating the umbones; ligament contained in a groove running across the
  area; muscular impressions one in each valve, large, sub-orbicular; both
  valves flat, narrow at the dorsal, broad at the ventral extremities;
  lower valve with raised edges overwrapping the upper.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This singular genus, of which only one species is known, differs from
  Ostrea, not only in shape and structure, but also in the mode of
  attachment, which is by means of a byssus passing through the lower
  valve, in Pedum, but by a portion of the outer surface of the shell in
  Ostrea. P. Spondyloideum (fig. 179) is the only species at present known.

  with lines and waves of various and delicate colours, and if the genus be
  restricted to those species which are smooth, and which have a thick
  shelly operculum, we may regard it as well defined; but there are some
  spirally-grooved species of <span class="sc">Turbo</span>, Linn. which,
  from their oval shape, have been considered as belonging to this genus.
  Such species should not, in our opinion, be retained in this genus; they

  <p>PHOLADARIA. Lam. A family of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam. The

  rocks, wood, &amp;c. They are cylindrical in form. Lamarck here places
  <span class="sc">Pholas</span> and <span class="sc">Gastrochæna</span>,
  the last of which belongs more properly to the family of Tubicolaria,
  where we have enumerated it. Pholas has been divided into <i>Pholas</i>,
  fig. 55, <i>Martesia</i>, which has the valves nearly closed; and
  Pholadidæa, fig. 56, which has the cup-shaped extension. The genus
  Pholadomya, fig. 67, has been added, although of doubtful character. The
  genus Galeomma, fig. 58, 59, has also been recently added.</p>

  <p>PHOLADIDÆA. Leach. <span class="sc">Pholas</span> papyracea, Auct.
  Remarkable for the cup-shaped process at the posterior extremity. Fig.
  56.</p>

  <p>PHOLADOMYA. Sow. (<i>Pholas</i> and <i>Mya</i>.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Pholadaria, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, rather hyaline, equivalve,
  inequilateral, ventricose, posteriorly gaping, elongated, anteriorly
  short, rounding; ventral margin rather gaping; hinge with an elongated
  pit, and lateral plate in each valve; ligament external, short, muscular
  impressions two in each valve, rather indistinct; palleal impression with
  a large sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The only recent species of this genus is
  from the island of Tortola. Several fossil species occur in rocks of the
  Oolitic series. Fig. 57, P. candida.</p>

  <p>PHOLAS. Auct. (<span title="PHôleô" class="grk"

  class="sc">Adesmacea</span>, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Transverse, oblong,
  equivalve, inequilateral, imbricated, gaping on both sides, the anterior
  hiatus being generally the largest, although sometimes nearly closed,
  with the dorsal margin surmounted with one or more laminar accessary
  valves; hinge callous, reflected, with a long curved tooth protruding
  from beneath the umbones in each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of
  marine shells, dwelling in holes formed in rocks, wood, &amp;c. is easily
  distinguished from any other nearly allied genus by the curved,
  prominent, rib-like teeth. Fig. 55, P. Dactylus; 56. P. papyracea.</p>

  <p>PHONEMUS. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>PHORUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Trochus</span> agglutinans, Auct.
  Remarkable for the adhesion of little pebbles, dead shells, &amp;c. to
  the outer edge of the whorls, which are taken up in the course of the
  growth of the shell. From this circumstance they are called "Collectors,
  Carriers, &amp;c." Fig. 360. Recent species are brought from the East and
  West Indies; fossil species are found in the Tertiary beds.</p>

  <p>PHOS. Montf. <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera? Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Turrited, thick, cancellated, varicose; spire pointed, generally longer
  than the aperture; aperture rounded or oval; outer lip having internal
  ridges, with a sinus near the anterior termination; columella with an
  oblique fold; canal short, forming externally a raised
  varix.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The raised external surface of the canal, brings
  this genus near to Buccinum, while, in general appearance, most of the
  species more nearly resemble Murex. They have, however, no true varices
  on the whorls, but merely raised bars. Fig. 416, P. senticosus.</p>

  <p>PHYLLIDIANA. Lam. A family belonging to the first section of the order
  Gasteropoda, Lam. The genera belonging to this family may be

  <p>PINNA. Auct. (<i>The fin of a fish.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Mytilacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral, oblique, wedge-shaped,
  thin, horny; umbones terminal; hinge rectilinear, without teeth; anterior
  margin sinuated, to admit the passage of a byssus; posterior margin
  truncated, gaping; muscular impressions two in each valve; posterior
  large, sub-central; anterior small, terminal, sometimes
  double.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The beautiful large shells of which this genus
  is composed, are possessed of a large, flowing, silky byssus, of which
  gloves and hose have been manufactured. They have received their name
  from their resemblance to the pectoral fins of some fishes. Some species
  attain very large dimensions, and measure two feet in length. A very
  improbable story is told with regard to animals of this genus, namely
  that a certain small species of crab is in the habit of taking refuge
  from its enemies in the shell of the Pinna, into which it is received
  with great hospitality and kindness by the "<i>blind slug</i>," which
  inhabits it. In return for which kindness, he occasionally goes abroad to
  procure food for both. On his return he knocks at the shell, which is
  opened to receive him, and they share the supplies together in convivial
  security! Some species are smooth, although the greater number are
  imbricated or crisped outside. P. saccata, fig. 162.</p>

  <p>PINNATED. (From <i>Pinna</i>, a fin.) When a part of a shell is spread
  out and smooth, as in Rostellaria columbaria, fig. 403, it is said to be
  <i>alated</i>, or winged, but when the part which is spread is radiated
  or ribbed, like the fin of a fish, it is <i>pinnated</i>, as in Murex
  pinnatus, and Murex tripterus. (Conch. Illustr.)</p>

  <p>PIRENA. Lam. A genus of fresh-water shells, rejected by De Ferussac
  and other authors, who place Lamarck's two first species with Melanopsis,

  <p>PISIDIUM. Leach. A genus of river shells separated from Cyclas
  principally on account of a difference in the animal. The species of
  Pisidium, however, are less equilateral than the Cyclades, and the

  >&pi;&lambda;&alpha;&kappa;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>placos</i>, a cake.) <i>Fam.</i> Ostracea, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Compressed, thin, equivalve, nearly equilateral,
  planorbicular, fibrous, foliaceous; hinge flat, with two diverging ribs
  in one valve, and two corresponding grooves in the other, containing the
  cartilage; muscular impressions one, large, circular, central, and one or
  two smaller in each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The two best known species
  of this well defined genus are the P. Placenta, commonly called the
  Chinese Window Shell, and the P. Sella, called the Saddle Oyster, from
  the anterior margin being turned up so as to resemble a saddle. The genus
  may be known from all others by the diverging costa on the hinge.
  Placunanomia is the only genus resembling it in this respect, but this is
  easily distinguished by a perforation through the shell. Fig. 184, P.
  Placuna. These shells are used in China to glaze windows.</p>

  <p>PLACUNANOMIA. (Sw. <i>Placuna</i> and <i>Anomia</i>.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Ostracea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, foliaceous, compressed,
  sub-equivalve, sub-equilateral, irregular, flat near the umbones,
  plicated towards the margins, attached by a bony substance passing
  through a fissure in the lower valve; hinge flat, with two diverging ribs
  in one valve, corresponding with two diverging grooves, containing the
  cartilage, in the other; muscular impressions one in each valve, central,
  sub-orbicular.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The specimens from which Mr. Broderip
  described this singular genus, were brought by Mr. Cuming from the gulf
  of Dulce in Costa Rico. Another species is from one of the Philippine
  Islands. They partake of the characters of several genera, having the
  hinge of Placuna, and being attached by a process passing through the
  lower valve, like Anomia. P. Cumingii, fig. 189.</p>

  triangular notch in the other.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus, one species
  of which is spinous, and another smooth, is only known in a fossil state.
  It is found in the Lias and chalk. Fig. 176, P. spinosum.</p>

  <p>PLAIT or FOLD. A term applied to the prominences on the columellar lip
  of some univalve shells, particularly in the sub-family of Volutidæ.
  <i>Ex.</i> Voluta, fig. 433; Cymba, 434; and Melo, fig. 435.</p>

  <p>PLANARIA. Brown. A minute fossil resembling Planorbis in appearance,
  but differing in being a marine shell, and having a reflected outer lip.
  P. nitens, fig. 312, from Lea's Contributions to Geology.</p>

  <p>PLANAXIS. Lam. (<i>Plana</i>, flat; and <i>axis</i>.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Turbinacea, Lam. Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-ovate,
  pyramidal, solid; spire measuring ½ or &#x2153; of the axis, consisting
  of few whorls; columella contiguous to the axis, flat, truncated, and
  separated from the outer lip by a short canal; outer lip thickened and
  denticulated within; operculum horny, thin, with a terminal
  nucleus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is a genus of small marine shells found
  in the West Indies, &amp;c. Fig. 365, P. sulcata.</p>

  <p>PLANE. (<i>Planus.</i>) Flat, planed, as the columellar lip of
  Purpura, fig. 414.</p>

  <p>PLANORBICULAR, (<i>Planus</i>, flat; <i>orbis</i>, an orb.) Flat and
  circular, as Ammonites, fig. 478.</p>

  <p>PLANORBIS. Müll. (<i>Planus</i>, flat; <i>orbis</i>, an orb.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Lymnacea, Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, horny,
  convolute, planorbicular, nearly symmetrical; spire compressed, concave,
  consisting of numerous gradually increasing whorls, which are visible on
  both sides; aperture transversely oval, or nearly round; peritreme
  entire; outer lip thin; inner lip distinct, spread over a part of the
  body whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is a genus of shells abounding in all
  climates in ditches and stagnant pools, not liable to be confounded with
  any other, excepting the discoidal species of Ampullaria, which may be
  distinguished by the aperture being broadest in the opposite direction.
  It is further to be remarked that the discoidal Ampullariæ are dextral
  shells, and the Planorbes are sinistral or reversed; and although the
  latter are sometimes so flat and orbicular that it is difficult to know
  which is the spiral side, it may nevertheless always be ascertained by a
  careful examination. Fossil species are found in the freshwater strata of
  the Isle of Wight, and the neighbourhood of Paris. Fig. 311, P.
  corneus.</p>

  <p>PLANORBULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>PLANULACEA. Bl. The second family of Cellulacea, Bl. The microscopic
  Foraminifera contained in this family are described as very much
  depressed, not spiral, chambered, cellular, and having the septa
  indicated by grooves on the external surface of the shell, which increase
  in length from the apex to the base: some of the small cellular cavities
  are to be seen on the margins. This family contains the genera Renulina
  and Peneroplis.</p>

  <i>iris</i>.) A genus including several species of Nayades, referred to
  <span class="sc">Iridina</span>, Lam. The genus Platiris is divided into
  two sub-genera. Iridina, species which have crenulated margins; I. Ovata,
  I. exotica, Spatha, Lea; those with smooth or very slightly crenulated

  <i>Order.</i> Sessile Cirripedes, Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Balanidea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Conical, depressed, consisting of six valves,
  each divided internally by an angular plate jutting from the centre (like
  the buttress of a wall); operculum consisting of four valves in
  pairs.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus differs from Balanus, Coronula,
  &amp;c. in the internal structure of the valves. De Blainville's
  description of Chthalamus partly agrees with this. Fig. 19.</p>

  <p>PLECTOPHORUS. Fer. (<span title="plêktron" class="grk"

  <span class="sc">Carychium</span> undulatum, Leach. (<span
  class="sc">Caprella</span>, Nonnull.) This proposed genus is described as
  scarcely umbilical, dextral, oval, spiral; with the spire elevated,
  obtuse; the two last whorls very large, ventricose; aperture entire,
  elongated; columella with a single plait; the plait concave, inflected.
  Fig. 522, 523.</p>

  <p>PLEUROBRANCHUS. Cuv. (<span title="Pleura" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;</span>, <i>pleura</i>, the
  side; <i>Branchiæ</i>, gills.) <i>Fam.</i> Semiphyllidiana, Lam.
  Subaplysiacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Internal, thin, haliotoid,
  slightly convex towards the spiral apex; aperture
  entire.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is a very light shell, delicately
  coloured, resembling Aplysia, but differing in the integrity of the
  margin. Fig. 232, P. membranaceus.</p>

  <p>PLEUROCERUS. Rafinesque. A genus very imperfectly described in the
  "Journal de Physique" as "oval, or pyramidal; aperture oblong; outer lip
  thin; inner lip truncated at the columella, which is smooth and tortuous,
  not umbilicated. Operculum horny or membranaceous." De Blainville, in
  giving this description, remarks that he has neither seen the animal nor
  the shell of this genus, which he imagines to have been formed from the
  "Paludine Coupée de M. Say."</p>

  <p>PLEURORYNCHUS. Phillips. (<span title="Pleura" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&lambda;&epsilon;&upsilon;&rho;&alpha;</span>, <i>pleura</i>, the
  side; <span title="runchos" class="grk"
  >&rho;&upsilon;&gamma;&chi;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>rynchus</i>, a
  beak.) A genus founded upon a very singular species of <span
  class="sc">Cardium</span>, distinguished by the short anterior side, and
  the elongation of the hinge line into auricular processes, which are
  truncated at the extremities. C. Hibernicum from the Black Rock near
  Dublin, which is vulgarly called Asses-hoof, and C. elongatum (Sow. Min.
  Con. vol. I. 82.), form part of this genus.</p>

  <p>PLEUROTOMA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam. Siphonostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Fusiform, thick, in general ribbed or striated
  transversely; aperture oval, terminating anteriorly in an elongated
  canal; outer lip thin, with a fissure near its spiral extremity;
  columella smooth, nearly straight. Found principally in tropical
  climates.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus, which nearly resembles Fusus in
  other respects, may be known by the notch in the outer lip. The species
  differ in the length of the canal. Swainson has designated this genus a
  family, thus divided into genera: Brachytoma, in the description of which
  he says that the spire and aperture are of equal length, including the
  species strombiformis: Pleurotoma, in which the channel is so much
  lengthened, as to be little shorter than the spire: Clavatula, having the
  long narrow slit of Pleurotoma, but with a very short canal: Clavicantha,
  having the canal equally short, but the sinus or notch, instead of being
  linear and long, is short and wide; the surface is rough, and the whorls
  either coronated with prickles, or with compressed nodules resembling
  spines: Tomella, which has the spire and canal fusiform, but the spire of
  very few whorls, and the inner lip considerably thickened within where it
  joins the outer lip. Fig. 379, 389, P. marmorata; 381, P. Strombiformis,
  (Clavatula, Sw.)</p>

  <p>PLEUROTOMARIA. Defr. <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Turbinated, spiral; aperture sub-quadrate, with rounded angles; outer lip
  with a deep slit near its union with the spire.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This
  genus, which is only known in a fossil state, abounds in inferior Oolite,
  Oxford clay, and casts are found in a limestone bed in Norway. The
  Scissurellæ differ in being very minute shells, and are not so trochiform
  as the species of Pleurotomaria, P. reticulata, fig. 341.</p>

  Dendostrea, fig. 181.</p>

  <p>PLICATULA. Lam. (<i>Plicatus</i>, folded.) <i>Fam.</i> Pectenides,
  Lam. Sub-ostracea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Irregular, sub-equivalve,
  sub-equilateral, attached by a small part of the surface of one valve,
  strongly plicated; umbones separated by a small, external ligamentary
  area; hinge with two cardinal teeth in each valve, two approximate in one
  valve, received between two distant in the other; cartilage placed
  between the cardinal teeth; muscular impressions one in each
  valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The cardinal teeth resembling those of
  Spondylus, distinguish this genus from others of the Lamarckian family
  Pectenides. Very few species are yet known, they are brought from the
  East and West Indies and the Philippine Islands. Fossil species are found
  in several of the supra-cretaceous beds. Fig. 178, P. gibbosa.</p>

  <p>PNEUMOBRANCHIA. Lam. The second section of the order Gasteropoda, Lam.
  containing the family Limacinea, fig. 256 to 263.</p>

  <p>PODOPSIS. Lam. This genus appears to have been described from
  specimens of a species of Spondylus, with the triangular disc broken out,
  so as to present a similarly shaped foramen, which was supposed to afford
  a passage for a large byssus.</p>

  Conical, compressed, consisting of numerous valves, mostly in pairs,
  three or four pairs forming the principal part of the shell, and
  surrounded at the base by two or three rows of smaller valves, supported
  on a scaly, short pedicle.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This description will be
  found to exclude Scalpellum, and Smilium, the valves of which are more
  equal. The P. Mitellus, Auct. (fig. 37*), has been separated as a genus
  under the name of Mitellus by some authors, and it is certainly very
  different from P. polymerus, fig. 37, and P. cornucopia.</p>

  shells of which are described as straight, more or less symmetrically
  convolute, divided into several chambers. The septa are sometimes, but
  not always, pierced by one or more siphons. This order is divided into
  the families, Orthocerata, Lituacea, Cristacea, Ammonacea, Nautilacea,
  Turbinacea, Turriculacea, all of which contain genera of chambered
  shells. De Blainville arranges these families according to the degree in
  which the spires revolve. The first being straight, as the Orthocerata,
  and the last being so closely coiled up, that the last whorl covers the
  rest, as in the Nautilacea.</p>

  <p>POLYTHALAMIA. Lam. The first division of the order Cephalopoda, Lam.

  <p>POLYXENES. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>POMATIA. Gesner. (Gray, Syn. B. M. p. 133.) A genus of the family of
  "Cyclostomidæ," described as having "an elongated shell with reflexed
  lips, and a horny spiral operculum." Also a sub-genus of Snails,
  containing <span class="sc">Helix</span> pomatia, Auct. (Gray's Turton,

  <p>PORNUS. Humph. <span class="sc">Ampullaria</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>PORCELLANA. Adanson. <span class="sc">Marginella</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>PORODRAGUS. Montf. A genus composed of species of Belemnites, placed
  by De Blainville in the section characterized as swelled near the apex,
  and straightened towards the base.</p>

  <p>POSIDONIA. Brong. A genus formed on the cast of a bivalve shell,
  common on schists from Dillemberg.</p>

  <p>POSTERIOR. (<i>After</i>, <i>behind</i>.) The posterior or hinder part
  of a bivalve shell, is that in which the siphonal tube of the animal is
  placed. It is known in the shell, by the direction of the curve in the
  umbones, which is from the posterior towards the anterior; also by the
  ligament, which is always placed on the posterior part of the hinge, when
  it exists only on one side of the umbones; and by the sinus (when there
  is one) in the palleal impression, which is always near the posterior
  muscular impression. In some shells, however, it is very difficult for a
  learner to trace these marks; such bivalves, for instance, as have the
  ligament spread out on both sides of the umbones; such as are nearly
  symmetrical, and have the umbones consequently straight, and a single
  muscular impression near the centre of the valve. The Brachiopodous
  bivalves have a different position, with relation to the animal, from the
  other bivalves, so that the hinge line is the posterior extremity, and
  the part where the valves open, is the anterior. The posterior extremity
  of the aperture of a spiral univalve shell, is that nearest to the spire.
  In patelliform shells the anterior and posterior extremities are
  distinguished by the muscular impression, which is annular, enclosing a
  central disc in the inner surface of the shell, excepting where it is
  interrupted by the place where the head of the animal lies, which of
  course is anterior. The posterior is marked <i>p.</i> in fig. 119, and
  387. See <span class="sc">Anterior</span>.</p>

  <p>POSTERO-BASAL MARGIN of a bivalve shell is the posterior side of the
  margin opposite the hinge.</p>

  <p>POSTERO-DORSAL MARGIN is the posterior side of the hinge.</p>

  <p>POTAMIS or POTAMIDES. Brong. A genus of fresh-water shells resembling
  Cerithium in the characters of the aperture, but which may be known from
  that genus by the thick, horny epidermis with which they are coated. P.
  muricata, fig. 377. (Cerithium, Sow.) We think that these shells should
  be placed near <span class="sc">Melania</span>.</p>

  <p>POTAMOMYA. A genus of shells resembling Corbula, in every respect
  except that of being inhabitants of fresh-water. Fig. 498, 499,
  represents one of these fresh-water Corbulæ.</p>

  <p>POTAMOPHILA. Sow. (<span title="Potamis" class="grk"
  >&Pi;&omicron;&tau;&alpha;&mu;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>potamis</i>,
  river; <span title="philios" class="grk"
  >&phi;&iota;&lambda;&iota;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>philios</i>,
  choice.) "Conques fluviatiles," Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thick,
  equivalve, inequilateral, trigonal, covered with a greenish brown,
  smooth, horny epidermis; hinge thickened, broad, with one central,
  notched cardinal tooth in one valve, and two in the other, with
  indistinct lateral teeth; ligament large, supported on prominent fulcra;
  muscular impressions two in each valve, sub-orbicular.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  The name given to this shell refers to its place of abode, being found in
  rivers. It is the Venus sub-viridis of some authors, although being a
  fresh-water shell, and having an incrassated hinge, and a smooth, thick
  epidermis, it is most distinct from that genus. It is described by
  Bowdich under the name Megadesma, on account of its large ligament, and
  by Lamarck under that of Galathæa, a name previously used by him for a
  genus of Crustacea. P. radiata, fig. 115. Megadesma appears to be the
  preferable name, since it has the right of priority over Potamophila. It
  is found in Africa.</p>

  <p>PRIAMUS. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Achatina</span> Priamus,
  Lam. <span class="sc">Buccinum</span> Stercus&mdash;Pulicum, Chemn.
  Conch. 9. t. 120. f. 1026-7. This shell is ascertained to belong to a
  marine mollusc, having a horny operculum, and therefore is justly
  considered to form a distinct genus, allied to the Buccina and
  Struthiolariæ. Fig. 545.</p>

  <p>PRISODON. Schum. <span class="sc">Hyria</span>, &amp;c. Auct. Fig.
  144.</p>

  <p>PRODUCED. (<i>Productus</i>, prominent.) A term applied to the spire
  of univalve shells, or to any other prominent portion.</p>

  <p>PRODUCTA. Sow. (<i>Productus</i>, produced.) <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equilateral, inequivalve, thick, striated; one
  valve generally convex, with the margin inflected, produced; the other
  valve flat, or slightly convex, with the margin reflected; hinge
  rectilinear, transverse.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The peculiarity of this genus,
  from which it derives its name, is the manner in which the anterior
  margins of the valves are drawn out and overwrap each other. The genus is
  only known in a fossil state. Species occur in Mountain Limestone, and
  Transition Limestone of older date. P. depressa, fig. 206.</p>

  <p>PROSERPINA. Gray? Fig. 274, represents a small shell belonging to the
  Helix tribe, to which it is believed, Mr. Gray has applied the name
  Proserpina nitida. We do not know how the genus is defined.</p>

  <p>PROTO. Defr. A fossil shell resembling <span
  class="sc">Turritella</span>, but having a spiral band reaching to the
  centre of each valve. P. terebralis, Bl.</p>

  <p>PSAMMOBIA. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Nymphacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Transverse, oblong, slightly gaping at both ends; hinge with two cardinal
  teeth in one valve, one in the other; ligament supported upon a prominent
  fulcrum; muscular impressions two in each valve, sub-orbicular, distant;
  palleal impression with a large sinus; epidermis thin.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  The genus thus described includes <span class="sc">Psammotæa</span> of
  Lamarck, which, according to him, only differs in the number of teeth,
  and which he says are but "Psammobies dégenerées." The difference appears
  to be accidental. This genus differs from Tellina in not having a
  posterior fold in the margin. Fig. 100. The species are found in
  temperate and tropical climates.</p>

  <p>PSAMMOCOLA. Bl. (<span title="psammos" class="grk"
  >&psi;&alpha;&mu;&mu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>psammos</i>, sand;
  <i>cola</i>, an inhabitant.) A name given by De Blainville to shells of
  the genus <span class="sc">Psammobia</span>, including <span
  class="sc">Psammotæa</span> of Lamarck.</p>

  <p>PSAMMOTÆA. See Lam. <span class="sc">Psammobia</span>.</p>

  <p>PSEUDOLIVA. Sw. A genus of "Eburninæ," Sw. thus described: "Shell
  thick, oval, oliviform, ventricose; spire very short, acute; base with
  two parallel grooves, one of which forms a notch at the base of the outer
  lip; suture slightly channelled; inner lip very thick, and turning
  inwards; aperture with an internal canal. Connects the <span
  class="sc">Turbinellidæ</span> with the <span class="sc">Volutidæ</span>.
  P. plumbea, Chem. 188. f. 1806, 1807." Sw. p. 306.</p>

  <i>Fam.</i> Ailées, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turrited, oval, ventricose,
  thick, tuberculated; spire short; aperture oval, terminating in a
  lengthened canal at both extremities; outer lip thickened, expanded,
  produced into horn-shaped, hollow, thickened spires, with an anterior
  sinus apart from the canal.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus, containing the
  shells commonly called Devil's Claws, Gouty Scorpions, Spiders, &amp;c.
  is distinguished from Strombus by the digitations of the outer lip. No
  fossil species are known. Fig. 405, P. aurantiaca.</p>

  <p>PTEROCYCLOS. Benson. Syn. B. M. p. 133. A genus formed of species of
  Cyclostoma, Auct. which have "a groove or hole at the hinder part of the

  <p>PTEROPODA. Bl. The second family of Nucleobranchiata, Bl. the shells
  of which are described as symmetrical, extremely thin, transparent,
  longitudinally enrolled, either forwards or backwards. The animals are
  remarkable for a pair of broad, flat, natatory organs or membranaceous
  fins, from which the family derives its name. It contains, in the system
  of De Blainville, the genera Atlanta, Spiratella, and Argonauta, to which
  may probably be added <span class="sc">Pharetrium</span>, König; <span
  class="sc">Entalis</span>, Defrance.</p>

  <p>PULLASTRA. Sow. <i>Fam.</i> Conques Marines, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, ovate or oblong, transverse, inequilateral; hinge with three
  diverging cardinal teeth in each valve, notched at the terminations;
  muscular impressions two in each valve; palleal impression having a large
  sinus; ligament external, partly hidden by the dorsal

  and several species of his Veneres, they are found in the sand on the
  shores of temperate and tropical climates. Fig. 120, P. textile.</p>

  <p>PULMONOBRANCHIATA. Bl. The first order of the first section of
  Paracephalophora monoica, containing the families Limnacea, Auriculacea,
  and Limacinea.</p>

  <p>PULVINITES. Defr. (<i>Pulvinus</i>, a cushion.) <i>Fam.</i> Malleacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-equivalve, inequilateral, compressed, thin,
  slightly gaping posteriorly; one valve flat, the other rather concave;
  hinge linear, short, divided into perpendicular grooves; muscular
  impressions two, one sub-central, the other above it, nearer the
  hinge.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This fossil shell is imperfectly known, and it
  is difficult to give a sufficient reason for separating it from Perna. It
  comes from the Baculite limestone of Normandy. Fig. 170, P.

  obtuse, composed of numerous slowly increasing whorls; aperture
  sub-quadrate, rounded anteriorly, entire; outer lip thickened; columella
  plaited.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is composed of land shells very
  variable in form, differing from Bulinus in the numerous slowly
  increasing whorls of the spire, and in the plicæ on the columella, and
  from Clausilia in the want of a clausium. Britain, Southern Europe, East

  <p>PUPINA. Vignard. <span class="sc">Moulinsia</span>, Grateloup.
  <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Pupiform,
  sub-cylindrical; last whorl less than the preceding; surface brilliantly
  polished; suture of the spire enamelled; aperture circular; peritreme
  thickened; a notch at the base of the inner lip; operculum horny,
  spiral.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The species upon which this genus was
  originally founded, and described in the "Annal des Sciences Naturelles,"
  tome 18, p. 439, (December 1829,) is a small pupiform shell, having
  nothing to distinguish it but the enamelled suture and the notch in the
  aperture; characters quite insufficient in themselves for the purpose of
  generic distinction; at the same time sufficient to lead M. De Ferussac
  to the suspicion of its having an operculum. The next species, described
  by Grateloup under the name of Moulinsia Nunezii, (Ann. Soc. Linn. Burd,
  Nov. 1840), presents more remarkable characters, having the spire turned
  backwards and the penultimate whorl disproportionately large. Seven
  additional species have been lately brought to this country from the
  Philippine Islands by Mr. Cuming. They will be described by the author in
  the Zoological Proceedings for 1841, and an illustrated monograph of the
  whole genus is published in the Thesaurus Conchyliorum, Part I, by the
  Author. It may be observed that in one of the new species, the notch in
  the peritreme almost disappears, leaving a very slight sinus. Fig. 524,
  526, 527, 528.</p>

  <p>PURPURA. Auct. ("<i>The shell-fish from which purple is taken</i>,"
  Plin.) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam. Entomostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval or oblong, thick; spire for the most part
  short, sometimes rather longer; external surface generally sulcated,
  granulated, tuberculated or muricated; aperture long, oval, somewhat
  dilated, emarginated anteriorly; outer lip crenated, acute; columella
  flattened; operculum horny, with the nucleus lateral, thin towards the
  columella.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> True Purpuræ to be found in the Lamarckian
  genera Buccinum, Ricinula, and others. They may be generally
  distinguished by the flatness of the columellar lip, and by the short
  canal or emargination, which is not reflected or raised, as in Buccinum.
  The species are very numerous and very variable in form, inhabiting the
  seas of temperate and tropical climates. The animals secrete a purple
  liquor, which has been used advantageously for dyeing; the origin of the
  famous Tyrian dye. Fig. 414, P. persica.</p>

  <p>PURPURIFERA. Lam. (<i>Purpura</i>, purple; <i>fero</i>, to carry.) A
  family belonging to the second section of Lamarck's order Trachelipoda,
  the shells of which are described as having a very short recurved, or
  ascending canal, or else only a notch between the inner and outer lips.
  The name Purpurifera has been given to the family because the animals
  which it includes, and particularly the genus Purpura, contain the
  colouring matter from which the ancients obtained the well known splendid
  purple. This family contains the following genera.</p>

  >&Sigma;&iota;&phi;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>siphon</i>; <span
  title="stoma" class="grk">&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span>,
  <i>stoma</i>, mouth.) The first family of Siphonobranchiata, Bl. the
  shells of which are extremely variable in form, but always have a canal
  or notch at the anterior extremity of the aperture. This family partly
  answers to the Canalifera of Lamarck and the genus Murex in the system of
  Linnæus. It contains the genera Pleurotoma, Rostellaria, Fusus, Pyrula,
  Fasciolaria, Turbinella, Columbella, Triton, Murex, Ranella, and
  Struthiolaria.</p>

  <p>SIPHUNCLE. (Siphunculus.) A small siphon.</p>

  <p>SMILUM. Leach. <i>Fam.</i> Pedunculated
  Cirripedes.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thirteen pieces, ten of which are in
  pairs, lateral, subtriangular; one posterior dorsal, linear; all smooth;
  peduncle hairy.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from
  Pentelasmis, by the number of its valves, and from Scalpellum, by the
  hairy peduncle. S. Peronii, fig. 36.</p>

  <p>SNAIL. The common garden Snail, so destructive to our vegetables,
  belongs to the genus Helix. The water snail, found in ponds, is
  Planorbis.</p>

  <p>SOL. Humph. A genus consisting of several species of the genus
  Trochus, and corresponding with the sub-genus Tubicanthus, Sw. Malac.

  <p>SOLARIUM. Auct. (<i>A terrace, or gallery</i>.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Turbinacea, Lam. Goniostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Discoidal beneath,
  conical above, with a wide umbilicus, the spiral margin of which is
  angulated and crenulated; aperture trapezoidal; peritreme thin, sharp;
  columella straight; operculum horny, subspiral.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  Solarium Perspectivum, is commonly called the Staircase Trochus, from the
  angulated edges of the whorls being seen through the umbilicus, which
  reaches to the apex, and presents the appearance of a winding gallery.
  The species are not numerous, they belong to tropical climates. A few
  fossil species occur in the tertiary formations. Fig. 353, S.
  Perspectivum.</p>

  <p>SOLDANIA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>SOLEN. Auct. (<i>A kind of shell-fish</i>, Plin.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Solenacea, Lam. Pyloridea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Bivalve, transversely
  elongated, sub-cylindrical, equivalve, very inequilateral, gaping at both
  extremities, umbones terminal, close to the anterior extremity; hinge
  linear, with several small cardinal teeth, and a long, external ligament;
  muscular impressions distant, anterior tongue-shaped, placed behind the
  cardinal teeth, posterior irregular, sub-ovate; palleal impression long,
  bilobed posteriorly.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The above description of the genus
  Solen, is framed so as to admit only those species which are commonly
  called Razor Shells, with the umbones terminal, and the anterior muscular
  impression behind them. They are found buried deep in the sand, in a
  perpendicular position, their situation being pointed out by a dimple, on
  the surface. They are abundant in temperate climates. Some of the
  Lamarckian Solenes will be found in the genus Solenocurtus, Bl. Fig. 60,
  61.</p>

  <p>SOLENACEA. Lam. A family of the order Conchifera, Dimyaria Lam. The
  shells belonging to it are described as transversely elongated, destitute
  of accessary pieces, gaping only at the lateral extremities; ligament
  external.&mdash;The genera may be thus distinguished.</p>

  <p>SPHÆRULACEA. Bl. The first family of Cellulacea consisting of the
  following genera of microscopic Foraminifera: Miliola, Melonia,
  Saracenaria, Textularia.</p>

  <p>SPHÆRULACEA. Lam. The fourth family of Cephalopoda, Lam. described as
  multilocular, globular, sphærical, or oval, with the whorls enveloping
  each other; some of them have a particular internal cavity, and are
  composed of a series of elongated, straight and contiguous chambers which
  altogether form a covering for the internal cavity. This family contains
  the genera Miliola, Gyrogona and Melonia.</p>

  <p>SPHÆRULITES. Lam. (<i>Sphæra</i>, a sphere.) <i>Fam.</i> Rudistes,
  Lam. and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Orbicular, inequivalve, irregularly

  <p>SPINES. (<i>Spina</i>, a thorn.) Thin, pointed spikes.</p>

  <p>SPINOSE. (Spinosus.) Having spines or elevated points, as Neritina
  spinosa. Fig. 325.</p>

  <p>SPIRAL. (<i>Spira</i>, a spire.) Revolving outwards from a central
  apex or nucleus, like the spring of a watch. A shell or an operculum, may
  be spiral, without being produced into a pyramid. Bands of colour, striæ,
  grooves, &amp;c. commencing from the nucleus and following the volutions
  of the shell, are described by the above word.</p>

  <p>SPIRAMILLA. Bl. A genus of Serpulacea, differing from other Serpulæ
  principally in the characters of the animal.</p>

  <p>SPIRATELLA. Bl. <span class="sc">Limacinea</span>, Lam. Fig. 224.</p>

  <p>SPIRE. (<i>Spira.</i>) The cone or pyramid produced in a
  non-symmetrical univalve by its oblique revolution downwards from the
  apex or nucleus. The spire, in descriptions, includes all the volutions
  above the aperture. See Introduction.</p>

  <p>SPIRIFER. Sow. (<i>Spira</i>, a spire; <i>fero</i>, to bear.)
  <i>Order</i>, Brachiopoda, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Transverse,
  equilateral; hinge linear, straight, widely extended on both sides of the
  umbones, which are separated by a flat area in the upper and larger
  valve; this area is divided in the centre by a triangular pit for the
  passage of the byssus; interior with two spirally convolute
  appendages.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus, which is only known in a fossil
  state, is distinguished from Terebratula externally, by the flat area in
  one valve, internally, by the singular spiral process from which the
  above name is derived. Fig. 214, 215. Most of the species belong to the
  mountain or carboniferous limestone.</p>

  <p>SPIROGLYPHUS. Daud. A genus consisting of a species of Serpula
  <i>Auct.</i> which makes a groove for itself in the surface of shells.
  Serpula spirorbis, var. Dillwyn. Fig. 8.</p>

  <p>SPIROLINA. Lam. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>SPIROLOCULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>SPIRORBIS. Lam. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Serpula</span>, Auct. which are coiled round in a spiral disc
  like a snake at rest. S. nautiloides, fig. 5, is the common little white
  shell, found upon the shell of lobsters.</p>

  <p>SPIRULA. (<i>Spira</i>, a winding compass.) <i>Fam.</i> Lituolata,
  Lam. Lituacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Convolute, smooth, symmetrical,
  discoid, with parallel unconnected whorls, divided into numerous chambers
  by transverse septa; siphon continuous.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This pretty
  little shell is partly internal, only a part of it being visible when on
  the animal. Fig. 471.</p>

  <p>SPISULA. Gray. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Mactra</span>
  fragilis, and other similar species, which have the ligament
  sub-external, marginal, not separate from the cartilage; with the
  posterior lateral teeth double in one valve, and single in the other. M.
  fragilis, fig. 80, is the species figured for Spisula in Mr. Gray's paper
  on the Mactradæ, in the second series of Loudon's Magazine of Natural
  History. We have since learned, however, that it was figured there by
  mistake, not having been intended for a Spisula, but belonging more
  properly to the genus Mactra, as defined by Mr. Gray, whose description
  of Spisula, is as follows:&mdash;"Shell ovate, trigonal, sub-angular at
  each end. Hinge and lateral teeth as in Mactra, but hinge of left tooth
  small. Siphonal inflexion ovate." The principal difference between
  Spisula and Mactra is, that the ligament is not separated from the
  cartilage in the former.</p>

  <p>SPONDYLUS. Auct. (<i>A shell-fish</i>, Ancients.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Pectenides, Lam. Sub-ostracea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequivalve,
  sub-equilateral, irregularly foliaceous and spinose, auriculated,
  denticulated at the margins, attached by the lower and deeper valve;
  hinge rectilinear, with two prominent teeth in each valve, locking into
  corresponding cavities in the opposite valve; umbones separated by a
  broad, elongated, triangular disc in the lower valve; ligament contained
  in a groove, dividing the triangular area in the centre; muscular
  impressions one in each valve, sub-central, sub-orbicular. The
  Mediterranean, East and West Indies, and China, produce Spondyli most
  abundantly.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is remarkable for the richness
  and beauty of the spines and foliations, which adorn the external surface
  of most of the species, the splendid colours by which many of them are
  varied, and the natural groupings formed by their attachment to each
  other. Fig. 177, and Frontispiece.</p>

  <p>SPORULUS. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>SQUAMOSE. (<i>Squama</i>, a scale.) Scaly, covered with scales, as the
  pedicle of Pollicipes Mitellus, fig. 37*.</p>

  <p>STENOPUS. Guild. (<span title="Stenos" class="grk"
  >&Sigma;&tau;&epsilon;&nu;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, narrow, <span
  title="pous" class="grk">&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;</span>, foot.) A
  genus nearly "allied to the Linnæan Helices, from all of which it differs
  in the curious contraction of the pedal disc, and the caudal tentaculum
  furnished with a gland beneath." The shell is described as heliciform,
  umbilicated, transparent, with the aperture transverse. The two species
  described are Stenopus cruentatus and lividus; they are both from the
  Caribbæan Islands, Guild. Zool. Journ. xii. p. 528, tab. 15, f. 1 to
  5.</p>

  <p>STOMATELLA. Lam. See <span class="sc">Stomatia</span>.</p>

  <p>STOMATIA. Auct. (<span title="stoma" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&tau;&omicron;&mu;&alpha;</span>, <i>stoma</i>, mouth.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Macrostomata, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-orbicular, oblong,
  auriform, variegated without, iridescent within; spire depressed;
  aperture entire, very wide, oblique; peritreme uninterrupted. <i>Obs.</i>
  This genus is known from Haliotis by being destitute of the series of
  holes; is distinguished from Sigaretus by the substance of the shell, the
  latter being internal, and never pearly. Our description includes <span
  class="sc">Stomatella</span>, Lam. The Stomatiæ are marine, and belong to
  the East Indies and New Holland. Fig. 335, S. Phymotis.</p>

  <p>STORILLUS. Montf. 1, 131. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera,
  included in the genus Rotalites in M. De Blainville's system.</p>

  <p>STRAPAROLLUS. Mont. A genus containing some species of <span
  class="sc">Helix</span>, Auct. Generic characters not defined.</p>

  <p>STREPTAXIS. Gray. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Ovate, or oblong; when young, sub-hemispherical, deeply umbilicated, with
  rapidly enlarging whorls. At length the penultimate whorl is bent towards
  the right and dorsal side of the axis, and the umbilicus becomes
  depressed, and often nearly closed. The mouth is lunulate, the edge
  slightly thickened and reflected, and often with a single tooth on the
  outer side of the inner lip.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of land shells
  is separated from Helix on account of the eccentricity of the penultimate
  whorl. S. contusa, fig. 269.</p>

  <p>STRIATED. (<i>Stria</i>, a groove.) Marked with fine grooves or
  lines.</p>

  <p>STRIGOCEPHALUS. Defr. <span class="sc">Pentamerus</span>, Sow.? <span
  class="sc">Gypidia</span>, Dalman.</p>

  <p>STROMBUS. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Alatæ, Lam. Angiostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oblong, turrited, rather ventricose, solid;
  aperture generally lengthened, terminating posteriorly in a short canal,
  and anteriorly in an emargination or truncated canal; outer lip, when
  young, thin; when full grown, thickened and expanded, lobed at the spiral
  extremity, sinuated anteriorly near the caudal canal.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This well known genus includes some species of immense size, commonly
  called conch shells. Most of the recent species are brought from the
  Indian Ocean. Very few fossil species are known. The young shells have
  very much the appearance of cones, the outer lips being thin. There are
  also several species which do not, even when full grown, thicken their
  outer lips very considerably. The genus Strombus is distinguished from
  Rostellaria, by the notch in the outer lip, which in the latter genus is
  close to the canal. Fig. 406, S. pugilis.</p>

  <p>STROPHOMENA. Rafinesque. <span class="sc">Orthis</span>, Dalman.</p>

  <p>STROPHOSTOMA. Deshayes. A fossil shell, of the family of Colimacea,
  Lam. in some degree resembling Anostoma, having the aperture turned
  upwards towards the spire, it is, however, umbilicated, and is said to
  have an operculum resembling that of Cyclostoma. It is the Ferussina of
  Grateloup. Fig. 534, 5, 6.</p>

  <p>STRUTHIOLARIA. Auct. (<i>Struthio</i>, an Ostrich.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Canalifera, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oblong, turrited, thick; spire
  turrited, composed of several angulated whorls; aperture oval,
  sub-quadrate, oblique; outer lip thickened, reflected, advancing in the
  centre, receding towards the extremities; inner lip thickened, expanded
  over the columella and part of the body whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This
  singular genus, consisting of three or four recent species, is named
  "Pied D'Autruche" by the French, on account of some resemblance in the
  outer lip to the foot of the Ostrich. From New Zealand. Fig. 391, S.
  straminea.</p>

  <p>STYLIFER. Brod. (<i>Stylus</i>, a style; <i>fero</i>, to
  bear.)&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, pellucid, turbinated; apex a little out
  of the perpendicular; aperture wide anteriorly, gradually narrowing
  towards the spiral extremity, where it terminates
  acutely.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This is a genus of small, transparent shells,
  found burrowing in the rays of Starfish. There are but two or three
  species at present known, one of which is elongated like Terebra, the
  other nearly globular. Fig. 12, S. astericola. West Indies, Gallapagos,
  and Britain.</p>

  <p>STYLINA. Flem. <span class="sc">Stylifer</span>, Brod.</p>

  <p>SUB. (<i>under.</i>) Used as a prefix and signifying nearly. Thus a
  bivalve-shell, the valves of which are nearly alike, would be described
  as <i>sub</i><span class="nw">-equivalve.</span></p>

  <p>SUB-APLYSIACEA. Bl. The first family of the order
  Monopleurobranchiata, Bl. containing several genera of Mollusca without
  shells, and the genus Pleurobranchus.</p>

  <p>SUB-BIVALVES. A term of distinction applied by De Blainville, to those
  spiral univalves which have an operculum; these, as they constitute two
  distinct pieces, he considers as forming a medium between univalves and
  bivalves.</p>

  <p>SUB-MYTILACEA. Bl. The sixth family of the order Lamellibranchiata,
  Bl. the shells belonging to which are described as free, rather pearly,
  regular, equivalve; hinge dorsal, laminated; ligament external; two
  muscular impressions; palleal impression not sinuated. This family, with
  the exception of the last genus, agrees with the family Nayades of
  Lamarck, and contains the genera Anodon, Unio, and Cardita.</p>

  <p>SUB-OSTRACEA. Bl. The second family of Lamellibranchiata, Bl. the
  shells of which are described as of a compact texture, sub-symmetrical;
  with the hinge rather complex; one single, sub-central, muscular
  impression, without any traces of palleal impression. This family
  corresponds with the Pectenides of Lamarck, and part of the genus Ostrea
  in the system of Linnæus. It contains the genera Spondylus, Plicatula,
  Hinnites, Pecten, Pedum, Lima.</p>

  <p>SUB-SPIRAL. Not sufficiently spiral to form a complete volution.</p>

  <p>SUBULA. Bl. (<i>An awl.</i>) A generic name under which M. De
  Blainville includes <span class="sc">Terebra</span> maculata, Auct. f.
  428, together with nearly all the species of Terebra, enumerated by
  Lamarck and other authors; only leaving in the latter genus those
  species, which being more bulbous, or ventricose, nearly resemble
  Buccinum in general form. These last mentioned species, such as Terebra
  buccinoidea, (fig. 247) have been formed into a new genus by Mr. Gray,
  under the name Bullia. If both these genera were adopted, the genus
  Terebra would be extinct.</p>

  <p>SUBULATE. (<i>Subula</i>, an awl.) A term applied to shells which are
  long and pointed as in Terebra. Fig. 427, 428.</p>

  <p>SUCCINEA. Drap. (<i>Succinum</i>, amber.) <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.
  Limacinea, Bl. <i>Sub-genus</i>, Cochlohydra, Fer.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Ovate, rather elongated; aperture large, entire, longitudinal; spire
  short; outer lip thin, continuous with the thin, sharp-edged columella;
  inner lip spread over a part of the body-whorl.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The
  shells belonging to this genus of partly amphibious mollusca, are
  distinguished from Limnæa by not having a fold on the columella The S.
  amphibia is of a bright amber colour. Fig. 265, 266. Temperate and
  tropical climates.</p>

  <p>SULCATED. (<span class="sc">Sulcatus</span>, lat.) Having grooves or
  furrows.</p>

  <p>SULCI. Grooves or furrows.</p>

  <p>SUTURE. (<i>Sutura</i>, lat.) A seam, stitch, joining together.
  Applied particularly to the line which marks the joining of the whorls of
  the spire. The suture is distinguished as <i>simple</i>, as in most
  cases; or <i>double</i>, when accompanied by a parallel groove close to
  it; <i>marginated</i>, when produced into a ledge by the matter which
  fills up and covers it; <i>obsolete</i>, when it is filled up so as not
  to be visible, as in the case of Ancillaria.</p>

  <p>SYLVICOLA. Humph. <span class="sc">Cyclostoma</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>SYMMETRICAL, (<span title="sun" class="grk"
  >&sigma;&upsilon;&nu;</span>, <i>syn</i>, similar; <span title="metron" class="grk"
  >&mu;&epsilon;&tau;&rho;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>metron</i>, proportion.)
  Both sides alike. Although the term is used thus as one of distinction,
  it is to be observed that no shells are strictly and perfectly
  symmetrical; even in the Nautilus, the apex verges in a slight degree
  towards one side of the shell. Two kinds of univalve are symmetrical, or
  nearly so; 1st. Those which are symmetrically convolute, as the
  Nautilacea and the Ammonacea, which are spiral; 2nd. Those which are not
  spiral, but simply conical, as the patelliform shells. Bivalves belonging
  to the Brachiopoda are also symmetrical. <i>Ex.</i> Patella, fig. 229.
  Ammonites, fig. 478.</p>

  <p>SYMPHYNOTA. Lea. A genus of Nayades, in which Mr. Lea proposed to
  include species of the genus <span class="sc">Unio</span>, the valves of
  which are connate, or united at the dorsal margin. We believe that this
  distinction, as a genus, has been abandoned by its author. The fact is,
  that all the Uniones are Symphynotæ when in a young state. In Unio
  Alatus, (fig. 147) and Dipsas plicatus, (fig. 142) it will be observed
  that the valves have not separated at the dorsal edge, but are broken
  lower down.</p>

  <p>TAPADA. (Gray. Turton. p. 127.) A division of the genus <span
  class="sc">Helix</span>, containing <span class="sc">Helix</span> aperta,
  Auct. or the Tapada snail.</p>

  <p>TAPES. Schum. <span class="sc">Pullastra.</span> Sow.?</p>

  <p>TECTUS. Montf. A genus composed of species of the genus Trochus,
  having elevated, conical spires, and columella notched or truncated by a
  spiral fold. Fig. 359. Trochus maculatus, presents an example.</p>

  <p>TELEBOIS. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>TELESCOPIUM. Montf. <span class="sc">Cerithium</span> Telescopium,
  Auct. fig. 378.</p>

  <p>TELLINA. Linn. <i>Fam.</i> Nymphacea, Lam. Conchacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-equivalve, inequilateral, compressed, rounded
  anteriorly, slightly beaked or angulated posteriorly, the posterior
  ventral margin having a flexuosity; hinge with two cardinal and generally
  two lateral teeth in each valve; muscular impressions, two in each valve,
  remote; palleal impression with a large sinus.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The fold
  or bending in the posterior margin distinguishes this genus from others
  which it nearly resembles. It is composed of some bivalves of great
  beauty and variety, which are found in nearly all climates. Fig. 105, T.
  radiata, 106, T. lingua-felis.</p>

  <p>TELLINIDES. Lam. <i>Fam.</i> Nymphacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Sub-equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, compressed, rounded anteriorly,
  slightly beaked or angulated posteriorly; hinge with two cardinal teeth
  in each valve, and one lateral tooth in one valve, very near the cardinal
  teeth. Muscular impressions two, distant, palleal impression with a large
  sinus. <i>Obs.</i> This genus is distinguished from Tellina in having but
  one lateral tooth near the cardinal teeth. Fig. 107, T. rosea.
  Tropical.</p>

  <p>TENUIPEDES. (<i>Tenuis</i>, slender; <i>pedes</i>, feet.) The second
  section of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, divided into the families
  Mactracea, Corbulacea, Lithophagidæ, Nymphacea.</p>

  <p>TERACLITA. Schum. <span class="sc">Conia</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>TEREBELLUM. Lam. (<i>Terebra</i>, an augur?) <i>Fam.</i> Convolutæ,
  Lam. Angyostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Smooth, slender, oblong,
  sub-cylindrical; spire obtuse, short, sometimes hidden; (Seraphs, Montf.)
  aperture long, narrow posteriorly, wider anteriorly; outer lip slightly
  thickened, truncated, unconnected at the base with the columella; inner
  lip thin, smooth, nearly straight, spread over a portion of the
  body-whorl, continued in a ridge above the sutures of the
  spire.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Montfort has separated the fossil species with
  hidden spires, under the name Seraphs. (T. convolutum, Lam.) Only one
  recent species is known, of which there are several varieties, one
  spotted, one marked in sub-spiral lines, another in patches. It is
  brought from the East Indies. Fig. 451, T. convolutum; 452, T.
  subulatum.</p>

  <p>TEREBRA. (<i>An augur, a piercer.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.
  Entomostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Subulate, elongated, pointed,
  turrited; spire long, consisting of numerous whorls; aperture small
  terminating in a short, reflected canal; outer lip thin; columella
  tortuous; operculum horny. The recent species are mostly
  tropical.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Nearly all the species enumerated by Lamarck
  and other authors are included by De Blainville in his genus Subula;
  those few species which that conchologist left in the present genus,
  being shorter and more ventricose than the others, approximate in shape
  to some of the Buccina, and are distinguished by Mr. Gray under the
  generic name Bullia. It seems strange, that De Blainville, being
  convinced of the necessity of separating the two groups, and consequently
  applying a new generic term to one of them, should have given that term
  to the larger number and the more typical species of the Lamarckian
  genus. Fig. 427, Bullia vittata. (Terebra.) Fig. 428, Terebra maculata.
  (Subula.)</p>

  <p>TEREBRALIA. Sw. A genus of "Cerithinæ," Sw. thus described: "Outer lip
  much dilated, generally uniting at its base to the inner lip; leaving a
  round perforation at the base of the pillar; channel truncate; operculum
  round: palustre. Mart. f. 1472." Sw. p. 315.</p>

  <p>TEREBRATING SHELLS. (<i>Terebro</i>, to pierce.) Shells which reside
  in holes pierced in rocks, wood, &amp;c. by means of some corrosive
  secretion of the animal. <i>Ex.</i> Pholas, Teredo, &amp;c.</p>

  <p>TEREBRATULA. Brug. (<i>Terebrans</i>, bored.) <i>Fam.</i> Brachiopoda,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Order.</i> Palliobranchiata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Inequivalve, equilateral, oval or sub-trigonal, ventricose or compressed,
  attached by a tendon passing through an opening in the dorsal, or upper
  and larger valve, the umbo of which advances beyond that of the other
  valve; hinge destitute of a ligament, with two teeth in the dorsal valve,
  locked into corresponding cavities in the ventral, or lower valve, and
  with two curious processes originating at the umbo of the lower valve,
  presenting, in some species, the appearance of fine winding tape,
  advancing towards the front of the valve, and again receding to the
  centre, where the ends unite; muscular impressions two, placed near the
  centre of each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Terebratulæ are included in
  the genus Anomia in the system of Linnæus. The recent species are not
  very numerous&mdash;they are found in all climates. The fossil species
  are more numerous than the recent ones, occurring in the secondary and
  tertiary formations. T. Psittacea, fig. 202.</p>

  <p>TEREDINA. (From Teredo.) <i>Fam.</i> Tubicolæ, Lam. Adesmacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Valves equal, inequilateral, with prominent
  umbones, as it were soldered to the outside of the rounded end of a
  shelly tube, of which they form a part; aperture of the tube partly
  divided; a flat accessary valve placed on the umbones.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i>
  This genus, which is only known in a fossil state, is distinguished from
  Teredo, by the valves being fixed on the tube, and the tube being closed
  at one extremity. Fig. 46, 47, T. personata.</p>

  <p>TEREDO. Auct. (<i>A piercer.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Tubicolæ, Lam.
  Adesmacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Valves equal, inequilateral;
  presenting when closed, an orbicular figure, with a large angular opening
  in front, and a rounded opening at the back; placed at the anterior
  extremity of an irregular, flexuous, elongated tube, open at both ends;
  the anterior termination divided in a double aperture opened and closed
  at the will of the animal by two opercula.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus
  of Molluscous Animals, is remarkable for boring holes in wood, which are
  filled by their elongated tubes, and give it a honey-comb appearance.
  Fig. 48. T. Navalis. Fig. 49, a piece of bored wood.</p>

  <p>TERMINAL. When the umbones of a bivalve shell are placed at or near
  the extremity, as in Mytilus, fig. 158, Pinna, fig. 162, they are said to
  be <i>terminal</i>. The same term is also applied to the nucleus of an
  operculum, when it forms an extreme point, or is close to one of the
  edges.</p>

  <p>TESSELLATED. (Wrought in chequer-work). A term applied to the
  colouring of shells, when arranged in regular defined patches like a
  tessellated pavement.</p>

  <p>TESTACELLA. (<i>Testa</i>, a shell.) <i>Fam.</i> Limacinea, Lam. and
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Haliotoid, compressed; aperture wide, oblique;
  columella flat, oblique; spire short, flat, consisting of less than two
  whorls.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell which is extremely small compared
  with the animal, is placed upon its back, near the posterior extremity.
  The animal is found in some of our gardens, and very much resembles the
  common garden slug. Fig. 261, T. Haliotoidea.</p>

  concave, sub-trigonal, with the umbo produced into a triangular, slightly
  incurved beak, and with two short, pointed processes advancing from
  beneath the umbones; upper valve flat, rounded square, with a short,
  blunt appendage, formed to fit between the tooth-like process of the
  other valve; its inner surface ornamented with symmetrically curved
  ridges.</p>

  312.</p>

  <p>THELIDOMUS. Sw. A generic name under which Swainson has described a
  division of the genus Helix, and which he has also used to designate a
  genus in the family of "Rotellinæ," founded upon an aggregate of loose
  particles collected and agglutinated in a spiral form by the larva of an
  insect. Sw. Malac. p. 330 and 353.</p>

  <p>THEMEON. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>THEODOXUS. Montf. A division of the genus Nerita. Fig. 324, N.

  <p>THETIS. Sow. (<i>A sea nymph.</i>) A genus of fossil shells, described
  as resembling Mactra, but not having the internal ligament, and having
  several small, acuminated, cardinal teeth, but no lateral teeth. It
  resembles Tellina in some degree, but has not the posterior fold.</p>

  to shells of the genus Belemnites.</p>

  <p>THIATYRA. Leach. A genus composed of <span
  class="sc">Amphidesma</span> <i>flexuosa</i>, Lam. and similar species,
  belonging more properly to the genus <span class="sc">Lucina</span>.</p>

  linear, or of equal breadth throughout; outer lip and base of the body
  whorl contracted, the former generally striated; an internal canal at the
  upper part of the aperture; shell (typically) turrited, and equally
  fusiform; representing the <i>Muricidæ</i> and Cymbiola." Sw. Malac. p.
  319. The principal difference between Tiara and Mitra appears to be that
  in the latter, the aperture is more linear and contracted in the centre.
  Mitra Episcopalis is an example.</p>

  <p>TINOPORUS. Montf. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>TIRANITES. Montf. A division of the genus Baculites.</p>

  <p>TOMELLA. Sw. A genus of "Pleurotominæ," Sw. thus described: "Fusiform,

  471.</p>

  <p>TONICHIA. Gray. Syn. B. M. p. 126. A genus composed of those species
  of Chiton which have the margin smooth.</p>

  <p>TORNATELLA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Plicacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oval,
  spirally grooved; spire short, rather obtuse, consisting of few whorls;
  aperture long, narrow, rounded anteriorly; outer lip simple; inner lip
  thin, slightly spread, columella spiral, incrassated, confluent with the
  outer lip. The recent species are few. Several fossil species occur in
  London Clay, Inferior Oolite and Calcaire-grossièr. Monoptygma, Lea,
  resembles this genus, but has a fold on the inner lip. Fig. 343, T.
  solidula.</p>

  <p>TORTUOUS. (<i>Tortuosus</i>) Twisted. This adjective is sometimes
  applied as a specific name; as Arca tortuosa.</p>

  <p>TRACHELIPODA. Lam. (<span title="trachêlos" class="grk"
  >&tau;&rho;&alpha;&chi;&eta;&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>,
  <i>trachelos</i>, a neck; <span title="poda" class="grk"
  >&pi;&omicron;&delta;&alpha;</span>, <i>poda</i>, foot.) The third order
  of the class Mollusca, in the system of Lamarck. The trachelipodous
  mollusca are described as having the posterior part of the body spirally
  twisted and separated from the foot; always enveloped in a shell. The
  foot is free, flat, attached to the base of the neck. Shell spiral, and
  enclosing the animal when at rest. This order contains the families,
  Colimacea, Lymnacea, Melaniana, Peristomiana, Neritacea, Janthinea,
  Macrostomata, Scalariana, Plicacea, Canalifera, Alata, Purpurifera,
  Columellaria, Convolutæ. The genera belonging to these families, are
  represented in the plates, fig. 264, to 462.</p>

  <p>TRANSVERSE. (Crosswise.) A shell is said to be transverse, when its
  width is greater than its length, that is, when it is longer from one
  side to the other than from the umbones to the ventral margins. The term
  is applied by some authors to express the direction of the lines of
  growth in bivalve shells, and the spiral lines in spiral shells. See
  <span class="sc">Concentric</span>.</p>

  <p>TRAPEZIUM. Meg. <span class="sc">Cypricardia</span>, Lam.</p>

  >&tau;&rho;&omicron;&pi;&iota;&sigmaf;</span> <i>tropis</i>, keel.)
  <i>Fam.</i> Purpurifera, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turbinated, keeled,
  thin, umbilicated; aperture longer than the spire, entire; columella
  obliquely truncated; outer lip thin, sharp; epidermis horny, produced
  into long hairs at the angles of the shell; operculum horny, with the
  nucleus lateral.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Although the shells of this genus have
  something of the shape of Turbo, they are distinguished from that genus
  at once by the thinness of the shell. They are also known from Buccinum,
  by the absence of a canal. Only two or three species are known, which
  belong to the Northern and Arctic Oceans. T. bicarinata, fig. 429.</p>

  <p>TRIDACNA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Tridacnacea, Lam. Chamacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, regular, inequilateral, radiately
  ribbed, adorned on the ribs with vaulted foliations, waved at the
  margins, with a large, anterior hiatus close to the umbones, for the
  passage of a large byssus, by which the animal fixes itself to marine
  substances; hinge with a partly external ligament; two laminar teeth in
  one valve, one in the other.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The beautiful shells
  composing this genus are of a delicate white colour, tinged with buff.
  One species, the T. gigas, attains a remarkable size, measuring from two
  to three feet across, and weighing five hundred pounds. Tridacna is
  distinguished from Hippopus by the large opening in the hinge. T.
  elongata, fig. 157.</p>

  <p>TRIDACNACEA. Lam. A family belonging to the first section of the order
  Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam. described as regular, equivalve, solid, and
  which are remarkable for the deeply sinuated or undulated ventral margin.
  This family contains the genera:</p>

  Equivalve, inequilateral, transverse, sub-trigonal, costated and
  granulated without, pearly and iridescent within, denticulated on the
  inner margin, rounded anteriorly, truncated posteriorly; hinge with four
  oblong, compressed, diverging teeth in one valve, receiving between their
  grooved sides, two similar teeth in the other; ligament external, thick;
  muscular impressions two in each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Only one recent
  species of this marine genus is known, the T. pectinata, which comes from
  New Holland; and was formerly so rare, that a much worn odd valve has
  been sold for a considerable sum. It is of a brilliant pearly texture
  within, tinged with purple or golden brown. Fossil species occur in Lias,
  upper and lower Oolite, and Green-sand. T. Pectinata, fig. 139.</p>

  <p>TRIGONOSEMUS. König. A genus composed of species of <span
  class="sc">Terebratula</span>, Auct. which have one valve produced into a

  species of <span class="sc">Cerithium</span>, Auct. which have the
  anterior canal closed at the anterior of the aperture, but opened at the
  extremity, and a small tubular opening on the upper part of the whorls,
  making three openings on the body whorl. This genus stands in the same
  relation to Cerithium as the Typhis to Murex. Fig. 375 in the old plates,

  <p>TRITON. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Siphonostomata, Bl. Canalifera,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Oblong or oval, thick, ribbed or tuberculated,
  with discontinuous varices placed at irregular distances; spire
  prominent, mammillated; aperture round or oval, terminating anteriorly in
  a generally long, slightly raised canal; columellar lip granulated or
  denticulated; outer lip thickened, reflected, generally denticulated
  within; epidermis rough; operculum horny.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> However
  nearly allied the Tritons may appear to be to the Murices and Ranellæ
  there are still to be traced in the shells of each of those genera,
  several constant and well marked distinctions, by which they maybe at
  once recognized. In the Ranellæ, the varices run in two rows along the
  spire; in the Murices, they form three or more rows; but in the Tritons,
  they do not follow each other, <i>i.e.</i> they do not occur in the same
  part of each volution. The large species of Triton, are sometimes used as
  trumpets. The Tritons are brought from the Mediterranean, Ceylon, the
  East and West Indies, and South Seas. Fig. 398 to 401.</p>

  <p>TRITONIDEA. Sw. A genus of "Buccininæ," Sw. thus described: "Shell
  bucciniform, but the basal half is narrowed, and the middle more or less
  ventricose; spire and aperture equal. Pillar at the base with two or
  three obtuse and very transverse plaits, not well defined; outer lip
  internally crenated and with a superior siphon; inner lip wanting, or
  rudimentary." This genus is the same as the one first distinguished by
  Mr. Gray under the name of Pollia. We do not regret the discovery made by
  Mr. Swainson of that name being previously occupied for a genus of
  Lepidopterous Insects. Fig. 415, represents Tritonidea articularis.
  (Pollia, Gray.)</p>

  <p>TRIVIA. Gray. A genus composed of those small species of <span
  class="sc">Cypræa</span>, Auct. which are characterized by small ridges
  on the dorsal surface, and have the anterior of the columella internally
  concave and ribbed. C. Pediculus. Auct. fig. 449, 450.</p>

  <p>TROCHATELLA. Sw. A sub-genus of Helicinæ, consisting of those species
  which are acute and trochiform.</p>

  <p>TROCHIA. Sw. A genus of the family Buccininæ, thus described: "shape
  intermediate between Purpura and Buccinum; whorls separated by a deep
  groove; inner lip when young, depressed, when adult, thickened, convex
  and striated; basal canal very small. T. sulcatus. E. M. 422. f. 4." Sw.
  Malac. p. 300.</p>

  <p>TROCHURUS. Humph. <span class="sc">Monodonta</span>. Lam.</p>

  <p>TROCHUS. Auct. (<i>A top.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.
  Goniostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turbinated, thick, striated,
  tuberculated or smooth; spire elevated, conical, consisting of numerous
  whorls; under surface discoid; aperture more or less depressed in an
  oblique direction, generally angular; columella arcuated, more or less
  prominent at its union with the outer lip, contiguous to the axis of the
  shell; operculum horny, orbicular, with numerous
  whorls.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> Lamarck distinguished this genus from Turbo by
  the general form, which is more conical, and the aperture, which is
  angulated, while that of Turbo is rounded. Monodonta or Odontis is only
  separated on account of the notch at the termination of the columella.
  But these characters glide so imperceptibly from one genus to the other,
  that there is no line of demarcation to be found but in the operculum.
  Accordingly, Sowerby (in Gen. of Sh. 37.) has stated his reasons for
  considering as Trochi, all the species which have horny opercula; and as
  Turbines, all those which have testaceous opercula. Fig. 358 to 360. The
  Trochi are found in all climates.</p>

  <p>TRUNCATELLA. Risso. A genus composed of several species of land shells
  which have been confounded by some authors with Cyclostoma. The genus is
  thus described: "Shell turriculated, cylindrical, decollated or truncated
  at the apex, no epidermis; aperture oval, short, with lips continuous,
  simple." <i>Ex.</i> Truncatella truncatulina, Lowe, Zool. Journ. t. 5. p.
  80. Our plates, fig. 520, 521. It is found on the shores of Britain, the
  Mediterranean, and West Indies.</p>

  operculum of four valves, placed perpendicularly in an
  epiphragm.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Tubicinellæ are found with nearly the
  whole shell buried in the thick skin of the whale. T. Balænarum.</p>

  <p>TUBICOLARIA. Lam. (<i>Tuba</i>, a tube; <i>cola</i>, an inhabitant.) A
  family of the order Conchifera Dimyaria, Lam. consisting of bivalves
  soldered as it were within, or connected with, a testaceous tube. The
  genera contained in this family may be thus distinguished.</p>

  <p>TURBINATED. (<i>Turbo</i>, a top,) Top-shaped. The term is applied
  generally to those shells which are large at one extremity, and narrow to
  a point at the other. <i>Ex.</i> Trochus, fig. 358; Turbinellus, fig.
  382.</p>

  <p>TURBINELLUS. Auct. (<i>A little top.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Canalifera, Lam.
  Siphonostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turbinated, thick, wide near the
  apex, generally tuberculated; spire short, depressed, mammillated;
  aperture rather narrow, terminating anteriorly in an open canal; outer
  lip thickened within; columella having from three to five prominent,
  compressed, transverse folds. The species of this genus are mostly
  tropical.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Turbinelli are a well marked genus of
  marine shells, the species of which are numerous. No fossil species are
  known. The genus Cancellaria makes the nearest approach to Turbinellus in
  some characters, but may be distinguished by the roundness of its form,
  the raised lines inside the outer lip, and the obliquity of the folds on
  the columella. Fig. 382 to 384.</p>

  <p>TURBO. Auct. (<i>A top.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Cricostomata, Bl. Turbinacea,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turbinated, solid, ventricose, generally grooved
  or tuberculated; spire short, pointed; aperture generally rounded,
  sub-effuse anteriorly, entire; operculum shelly, solid, incrassated on
  the outer side, horny and sub-spiral on the inner side. The Turbines are
  mostly tropical.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The only certain means of
  distinguishing this extensive genus of marine shells from Trochus, is the
  operculum, which in the latter genus is horny, spiral, and composed of a
  great number of whorls. The Trochi, however, are in general more conical,
  and flatter at the under side of the whorls, and this constitutes
  Lamarck's distinction between the genera. T. setosus, fig. 368.</p>

  <p>TURGID. (<i>Turgidus.</i>) Puffed up, swollen, inflated. This term is
  applied synonymously with Ventricose.</p>

  <p>TURRICULA. Humph. <span class="sc">Melania</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>TURRICULACEA. Bl. The seventh family of the Order Polythalamacea, Bl.
  containing the genus Turrilites, fig. 483.</p>

  <p>TURRILITES. Lam. (<i>Turris</i>, a tower; <span title="lithos" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, a stone.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Turriculacea, Lam. Ammonacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Chambered,
  turrited, spiral; septa sinuous and lobate, perforated by a siphon;
  aperture rounded, with the outer lip expanded. This genus, which is
  distinguished from the other Ammonacea by having the spire produced,
  <i>i. e.</i> not being convolute, consists of several species, occurring
  only in chalk-marl. Fig. 483.</p>

  <p>TURRIS. Montf. A genus composed of those species of <span
  class="sc">Mitra</span>, Auct. which have the whorls angulated, with the
  aperture lengthened and undulated.</p>

  <p>TURRITED. The spire of an univalve shell is said to be <i>turrited</i>
  when the whorls of which it is composed are regulated so as to have the
  appearance of little turrets rising above each other, as in Mitra, fig.
  431.</p>

  <p>TURRITELLA. Lam. (<i>A little tower.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Turbinacea, Lam.
  Cricostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Turrited, elongated, generally
  grooved spirally; spire pointed, consisting of numerous whorls; aperture
  rounded or angulated; inner and outer lips thin, confluent anteriorly;
  operculum horny.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The shells composing this well defined
  genus, are commonly called screws, a name to which the spiral grooves of
  most of the species seems to entitle them. Fig. 370, T. imbricata.</p>

  <p>TYMPANOSTOMA. Schum. (<i>Timbrel mouth.</i>) <span
  class="sc">Potamis</span>, Brongn.</p>

  <p>TYPHIS. Montf. A genus composed of <span class="sc">Murex</span>
  tubifer, Auct. and other similar species, which have the canal closed and
  a perforated tube between each varix on the angulated part of the whorls.
  Besides the fossil species originally described, there are now five
  species known, which are figured in part 200, of the Conchological
  Illustrations by the Author. Typhis tubifer, fig. 397.</p>

  <p>ULTIMUS. Montf. (<i>The last.</i>) A genus composed of <span
  class="sc">Ovulum</span> gibbosum, Auct. fig. 443, and other species in
  which the canals are not distinctly defined, nor elongated. This fanciful
  name is given to the genus on account of its being described in the last
  page of the book.</p>

  <p>UMBILICATED. (<i>Umbilicatus.</i>) Having an umbilicus, as Nautilus
  umbilicatus.</p>

  <p>UMBILICUS. (<i>A navel.</i>) The hollow formed in spiral shells when
  the inner side of the volutions do not join each other, so that the axis
  is hollow. The umbilicus is marked with the letter u in Helix algira,
  fig. 279. The term is also used to express any small, neat, rounded
  hollow.</p>

  <p>UMBO. (<i>The boss of a buckler or shield.</i>) The point of a bivalve
  shell above the hinge, which constitutes the apex or nucleus of each
  valve, from which the longitudinal rays diverge, and the lines of growth,
  commencing at the minutest circle, descend in gradually enlarging
  concentric layers to the outer margin. The umbones will be marked with
  the letter <i>u</i>, in Cytherea, fig. 117.</p>

  <p>UMBRELLA. (<i>A little shade.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Semiphyllidiana, Lam.
  Patelloidea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Patelliform, sub-orbicular,
  compressed, rather irregular; apex slightly raised, placed near the
  centre; margin acute; internal surface with a central, callous, coloured
  disc, surrounded by a continuous, irregular muscular
  impression.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus is known from Patella, by its
  continuous muscular impression. It is commonly called the Chinese
  Umbrella shell. There are but two species at present known; the U.
  Mediterranea, and the U. Indica, fig. 233.</p>

  <p>UNDATED. (<i>Unda</i>, a wave.) Waved.</p>

  <p>UNDULATED. (<i>Undulatus.</i>) Minutely waved.</p>

  <p>UNGUICULATED. (<i>Unguis</i>, a nail or hoof.) An unguiculated
  operculum is one in which the layers are disposed laterally, and the
  nucleus constitutes part of the outer edge.</p>

  <p>UNGULINA. Daud. (<i>Ungula</i>, a nail or claw.) <i>Fam.</i>
  Mactracea, Lam. Conchacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve,
  sub-orbicular, sub-equilateral, with margins entire, simple, closed all
  round; hinge with one short, sub-divided cardinal tooth in each valve,
  and a very minute additional tooth in one valve, an oblong ligamentary
  pit divided into two portions, one of which receives the cartilage, the
  external ligament is immediately below the umbones; muscular impressions,
  two in each valve, oblong; impression of the mantle entire. U.
  transversa, fig. 88. Coast of Africa.</p>

  <p>UNI-AURICULATED. Having one <span class="sc">Auricle</span>. See <span
  class="sc">Auriculated</span>.</p>

  <p>UNICORNUS. Montf. <span class="sc">Monoceros</span>, Auct.</p>

  <p>UNIO. (<i>A pearl.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Nayades, Lam. Submytilacea,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Inequilateral, equivalve, regular, free, pearly
  within, covered by a smooth epidermis without; umbones prominent,
  generally corroded; muscular impressions two in each valve, lateral,
  distant; the anterior composed of several small divisions; hinge varying
  in age, species, and individuals.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The above description
  is framed so as to include all the genera of the Lamarckian Nayades,
  together with Castalia, which are placed in the family Trigonacea, they
  are all fresh-water shells, commonly called fresh-water muscles. The
  distinctions of the various genera into which they have been divided,
  will be found in their respective places, and under the name Nayades.
  They are all represented in figures 140 to 152. Of these fig. 145 to 148,
  are more generally considered as forming the genus Unio.</p>

  <p>UNIOPSIS. Sw. A sub-genus of Alasmodon. Sw. p. 382.</p>

  <p>UNIVALVE. (<i>Unus</i>, one; <i>valva</i>, valve.) A shell consisting
  of a single piece, as distinguished from Bivalves and Multivalves, which
  are composed of two or more principal pieces. Spiral shells having an
  operculum, are called sub-bivalves by some authors.</p>

  <p>UPPER-VALVE. The free valve in attached bivalves.</p>

  <p>UVIGERINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VAGINA. Megerle. <span class="sc">Solen</span> <i>vagina</i>,
  Auct.</p>

  <p>VAGINULA. (<i>A little sheath, the husk of corn.</i>) <i>Class</i>,
  Pteropoda, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Pyramidal, slightly inflated in the
  centre, thin, fragile; aperture oblong, with the edges turned slightly
  outwards.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The little shells of this genus, which are
  only known in a fossil state, differ from Cuvieria in being pointed at
  the extremity. Found in the tertiary beds of Bordeaux. V. Daudinii, fig.
  225.</p>

  <p>VAGINULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VALVATA. Müll. <i>Fam.</i> Peristomata, Lam. Cricostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Thin, turbinated; spire short, composed of from
  three to six rounded whorls; aperture circular; peritreme acute, entire;
  operculum horny, spiral.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of small shells
  resembles Cyclostoma, from which the recent species may be known by the
  horny texture of the external surface, being fresh-water shells. The
  fossils of course belong to the fresh-water formations. V. piscinalis,
  fig. 322. Europe and North America.</p>

  <p>VALVES. (<i>Valva</i>, a door, a folding piece.) The two pieces
  composing a bivalve shell, which close upon each other, turning upon a
  hinge consisting of a ligament, cartilage, and teeth. See <span
  class="sc">Bivalve</span>, <span class="sc">Multivalve</span>, and <span
  class="sc">Univalve</span>.</p>

  <p>VALVULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VARIX. (<i>A swelling vein.</i>) A varix is formed on the outer
  surface of a spiral shell, by the thickened, reflected edge of a former
  aperture, after fresh deposits of testaceous matter have increased the
  size by adding to the growth of the shell beyond it. In this manner there
  are frequently many varices, or edges of former apertures, in various
  parts of the spire and the body whorl. They are sometimes placed at
  regular distances from each other, as in Harpa, fig. 419; sometimes
  <i>continuous</i>, as in Ranella, fig. 394; sometimes
  <i>discontinuous</i>, as in Triton, fig. 398; sometimes <i>ramose</i>, as
  in Murex, fig. 395; sometimes <i>simple</i>, as in Scalaria, fig. 351;
  sometimes <i>spinose</i>, as in Murex spinosus. The term <i>varix</i> has
  also been applied to any swelling ridge, such as that on the lower part
  of the columella of Ancillaria, fig. 456.</p>

  <p>VELATES. Montf. <span class="sc">Neritina</span> perversa, Auct. Fig.
  326.</p>

  <p>VELLETIA. Gray? A genus described as differing from <span
  class="sc">Ancylus</span> in being dextral. <span
  class="sc">Velletia</span> lacustris, <span class="sc">Ancylus</span>
  lacustris, Auct. fig. Sowerby Gen. fig. 2.</p>

  <p>VELUTINA. Auct. <i>Fam.</i> Macrostomata, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Sub-globose, covered with a velvety epidermis; spire short, composed of
  two rapidly enlarged ventricose whorls; aperture large, sub-ovate;
  peritreme thin, entire, separated from the last whorl; columella
  tortuous, thin.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell does not resemble any other
  genus in the family. Fig. 337. Northern Seas.</p>

  <p>VENERICARDIA. Lam. A genus composed of the shorter species of
  Cardita.</p>

  <p>VENERIRUPIS. Lam. (From <i>Venus</i> and <i>rupis</i>, a rock.) The
  oblong species of Venus Auct. which live in cavities of rocks and stones.
  This genus is united by Sowerby with some other species of Venus under
  the name Pullastra. V. Vulgaris, fig. 97.</p>

  <p>VENTRAL. (<i>Venter</i>, the belly.) The margin of a bivalve shell
  opposite the hinge. The under valve in Brachiopodous bivalves is the
  ventral valve. The ventral surface of an univalve spiral shell is that
  which faces the observer when the aperture is placed towards him. The
  ventral part of the whorls of symmetrical convolute shells, is the inner
  part, that which is nearest to the spire.</p>

  <p>VENTRAL SIPHON. In symmetrical convolute univalves, is one placed near
  the inner edge of the whorls.</p>

  <p>VENTRICOSE. (<i>Ventricosus.</i>) Swelled, rounded out, (<i>bombé
  Fr.</i>) as Harpa ventricosa, fig. 419.</p>

  <p>VENUS. Auct. (<i>Goddess of Beauty.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Marine Conchacea,
  Lam. Conchacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, inequilateral,
  sub-globose, sub-ovate, transverse, externally rugose, striated, ribbed,
  cancellated or smooth; margins entire, simple, close; hinge with three
  more or less distinct cardinal teeth, diverging from the umbones in each
  valve; muscular impressions two, lateral, distant; palleal impressions
  sinuated posteriorly; ligament external.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This extensive
  genus, including some bivalves of splendour and beauty, justifying the
  name given to it, may be known from Cytherea by the absence of a lateral
  tooth, which is found near the cardinal teeth in the latter. Artemis is
  distinguished not only by its beautiful form, but by the deep angular
  sinus in the palleal impression. Fig. 119, 119 <i>a</i>. Found mostly in
  temperate and tropical climates.</p>

  <p>VERMETUS. Adanson. <i>Fam.</i> Scalariana, Lam. Cricostomata,
  Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Spiral at the apex, irregularly twisted towards
  the aperture; aperture round, small.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell
  resembles the Serpulæ in general appearance, although it is regularly
  spiral near the apex. The animal is known to be a true mollusc, rather
  nearly allied to that of the genus Dentalium, which is also placed
  wrongly in the Lamarckian system. Vermetus Lumbricalis, fig. 345. Coast
  of Africa.</p>

  <p>VERMICULAR. (<i>Vermicularis.</i>) Worm-shaped, tubular, serpentine.
  <i>Ex.</i> Vermilia triquetra, fig. 7.</p>

  <p>VERMICULARIA. Lam. <span class="sc">Vermetus</span>, Adanson;
  afterwards <span class="sc">Vermetus</span>, Lam.</p>

  <p>VERMILIA. Lam. A genus composed of species of Serpula, which are
  attached by the whole length of the shell, no part being free. Vermilia
  triquetra, fig. 7.</p>

  <p>VERTEBRALINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VERTEX. Apex.</p>

  <p>VERTIGO. Müll. <i>Fam.</i> Colimacea, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Cylindrically fusiform, sinistral, hyaline; aperture marginated,
  sinuated, denticulated on the inner edge; peristome
  sub-reflected.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of minute land shells,
  resembles Pupa, but is a reversed, hyaline shell. Vertigo pusilla, fig.
  293. Europe.</p>

  <p>VERRUCA. Schum. <span class="sc">Clitia</span>, Leach.</p>

  <p>VESICA. Sw. A sub-genus of Bulinus, Sw. p. 360.</p>

  <p>VEXILLA. Sw. A genus of "Nassinæ," Sw. thus described: "General shape
  of <i>Purpura</i>, the inner lip flattened and depressed; the outer, when
  adult, thickened, inflected and toothed; aperture wide; picta <i>Sw.</i>
  Chem. pl. 157, f. 1504-5." Sw. Malac. p. 300.</p>

  <p>VIRGULINA. D'Orb. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VITRELLA. Sw. A sub-genus of "Bullinæ," Sw. Lardn. Cyclop. Malac. p.
  360.</p>

  <p>VITRINA. Drap. (<i>Vitreus</i>, glassy.) <i>Fam.</i> Limacinea, Lam.
  and Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Ovate, thin, glassy, fragile; spire short;
  last whorl large; aperture wide, transverse; peritreme simple; columella
  spiral, linear.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus of land-shells is not known
  in a fossil state. The recent species are found among moss and grass, in
  shady situations. De Ferussac has divided this genus into Helicolimax,
  fig. 263, and Helixarion, fig. 262.</p>

  <p>VITULARIA. Sw. A genus of "Muricinæ," Sw. thus described: "General
  habit of <i>Muricidea</i>, but the inner lip is depressed and flattened
  as in the <i>Purpurinæ</i>; varices simple, nearly obsolete. Tuberculata,
  Sw. En. M. 419. fig. 1. (<i>Murex vitulinus</i>, Auct.)" Sw. p. 297.</p>

  <p>VIVIPARA. A generic name given by Montfort, and retained by some
  authors for <span class="sc">Paludina</span>, Lam. on account of the
  animals being <i>viviparous</i>, i. e. the young being perfectly formed
  before they leave the ovaries.</p>

  <p>VIVIPAROUS. See <span class="sc">Vivipara</span>.</p>

  <p>VOLUTA. Auct. (<i>Volvo</i>, to revolve.) <i>Fam.</i> Columellaria,
  Lam. Angyostomata, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Sub-ovate, rather angulated,
  thick, generally tuberculated, smooth; spire short, conical, with a
  mammillated apex; aperture generally angulated, large, terminating
  anteriorly in a deep notch; columella smooth, with several plaits, of
  which the lowest is the largest; outer lip thickened
  within.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The genus Voluta, as left by Linnæus, is only
  characterized by the folds on the columella, and includes many shells
  which, although they agree in this respect with the genus, are yet quite
  opposite to each other in all other characters. Thus the Auriculæ, which
  are land shells, and have the aperture entire, are mixed up with others
  which are marine, and have a canal, as Turbinellæ, and the Fasciolariæ,
  and others which have merely a notch, as the true Volutes. This genus, as
  it is circumscribed at present, includes a great number of beautiful
  shells, most of which are rich in colouring. <span
  class="sc">Cymba</span> and <span class="sc">Melo</span> have been
  separated by Mr. Broderip from the genus <span class="sc">Voluta</span>
  of Lamarck, for reasons stated in their respective descriptions. Fig.
  443.</p>

  <p>VOLVARIA. Lam. (<i>Volva</i>, a shuttle.) <i>Fam.</i> Columellaria,
  Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Cylindrical, convolute, spirally striated; spire
  very short, nearly hidden; aperture narrow, as long as the whole shell;
  columella with three oblique plaits; outer lip
  dentated.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> The Volvaria are only known in a fossil
  state, and resemble some species of Bulla in general form, but are
  distinguished by the plaits on the columella. Fig. 439, V. concinna.</p>

  <p>VOLUTELLA. Sw. (<i>A little volute.</i>) A genus composed of those
  species of <span class="sc">Marginella</span>, Auct. which have the spire
  concealed, and the aperture smooth within. Fig. 438, <span
  class="sc">Persicula</span> of Schumacher.</p>

  <p>VOLUTILITHES. Sw. (<i>Voluta</i>, and <span title="lithos" class="grk"
  >&lambda;&iota;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf;</span>, <i>lithos</i>, a stone.)
  A genus composed of some fossil species of Voluta, which have the plaits
  on the pillar generally numerous, indistinct, and sometimes wanting
  altogether, with a pointed spire. Fig. 436, V. spinosa.</p>

  <p>VOLUTION. See <span class="sc">Whorl</span>.</p>

  <p>VORTICIALIS. Lam. A genus of microscopic Foraminifera.</p>

  <p>VULSELLA. Lam. (<i>A little tongue.</i>) <i>Fam.</i> Ostracea, Lau.
  Margaritacea, Bl.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i> Equivalve, irregular, longitudinal,
  compressed, oblong; umbones separated by a slight area in both valves;
  hinge with a large pit in the centre, containing the cartilage, the
  ligament being spread over the areas; muscular impressions, one on each
  valve, sub-central, oblong.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This genus differs from
  Ostræa in the equality of the valves, and in having a hollow pit in the
  hinge for the cartilage. Vulsella lingulata, fig. 185.</p>

  <p>WATERING-POT. Aspergillum, fig. 44, commonly so called on account of
  the resemblance of its perforated termination to that of the spout of a
  watering-pot.</p>

  <p>WENTLE TRAP. Scalaria pretiosa, commonly so called.</p>

  <p>WHORL. A complete turn or revolution round the imaginary axis of a
  spiral shell. The last whorl is called the <i>body-whorl</i>. The whorls
  are described as <i>non-contiguous</i>, when they do not touch each
  other; <i>continuous</i>, in the opposite case. <i>Depressed</i> when
  they are flat. They are <i>angulated</i>, <i>heeled</i>, or coronated;
  <i>distinct</i>, or indistinct. They are sometimes, as in Cypræa, hidden
  by the last whorl.</p>

  <p>XYLOPHAGA. Sow. (<span title="xulon" class="grk"
  >&xi;&upsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>, <i>zylon</i>, wood; <span
  title="phagô" class="grk">&phi;&alpha;&gamma;&omega;</span>,
  <i>phago</i>, to eat.) <i>Fam.</i> Tubiscolæ, Lam.&mdash;<i>Descr.</i>
  Equivalve, globose, closed at the back; with a large, angular hiatus in
  front; hinge with a small curved tooth advancing from beneath the umbones
  in each valve.&mdash;<i>Obs.</i> This shell, which is found in a
  cylindrical cavity, eaten in wood by the animal, resembles Teredo, but
  has not the shelly tube, nor the posterior hiatus. X. dorsalis, fig. 50,
  51.</p>

  <p>XYLOTRYA. Leach. <span class="sc">Xylophaga</span>, Sow.</p>

  <p>ZONITES. Montf. A genus formed of Helix Algira, and other similar
  species with depressed spires and large umbilici; included in the
  sub-genus Helicella. Fig. 279.</p>

  <p>ZUA. Leach. A genus described as differing from Bulinus in having a
  polished epidermis, and a thickened, not reflected lip. Zua lubrica, B.
  lubricus, Auct.</p>

  <p>This highly esteemed publication, by one of the most eminent
  Zoologists of the age, has long been considered very scarce, and from its
  being the sole property of the author has not hitherto been sold under
  the published price. In consequence, however, of his leaving England, he
  has thought it advisable to dispose of the whole stock to the advertiser,
  who now offers the complete copies, which are very few in number, at the
  low prices affixed.</p>

  <p>The whole of the figures are original, having been drawn by Mr.
  Swainson himself, chiefly from specimens in his own collection, and
  coloured under his immediate inspection. They are universally allowed to
  be unrivalled for beauty and fidelity.</p>

  <p>"It might, perhaps, almost be deemed presumption to offer any remarks
  on a work emanating from the pen and pencil of, undoubtedly, the first
  Ornithologist of the day, but we feel it our duty to give our readers
  <i>some</i> idea of the contents of the <i>Zoological Illustrations.</i>
  It will be sufficient, if we mention that his coloured figures of birds
  are almost unequalled,&mdash;they are certainly not surpassed. The
  figures are beyond conception lovely and delicate, and it only remains
  for us to remark, that <span class="sc">every philosophic Ornithologist
  must possess the Zoological Illustrations, if indeed they are now to be
  had</span>."&mdash;<i>Wood's Ornithologist's Text Book.</i></p>

  <p>No well-stored English Library should be without Woodville's Medical
  Botany, a work of long-established reputation, and the best on a subject
  which must, more or less, be interesting to every man of inquiry. It
  contains accurate figures and descriptions of all the plants used in
  English medicine, and is of such authority with professional men, as to
  be almost as essential to them as the Pharmacop&oelig;ia itself.
  Subsequent publications of a similar kind, though with Woodville as their
  text-book, have fallen greatly short of the original, as well in
  comprehensiveness of plan, as in accuracy of delineation and correctness
  of colouring. It having long been a matter of regret that so excellent a
  work, from the want of a new edition, should remain so much behind the
  present state of pharmaceutical science, Sir William undertook to supply
  this defect, by adding a Supplementary Volume, containing all the new and
  acknowledged discoveries, and all the plants added to the
  Pharmacop&oelig;ias since the publication of the work in 1810. New plates
  have likewise been given for the <i>Cinchonas</i>, and other plants,
  which were not properly identified in the time of Woodville; and new
  letter-press or <i>errata</i> for such descriptions as were deficient or
  incorrect. All these alterations and additions have been given in the
  supplementary or fifth volume, preserving everything contained in the
  original work, inclusive even of the incorrect plates and letter-press,
  though duplicate, leaving it to the purchaser's option either to cancel
  or retain them, as he pleases.</p>

<p class="ac scac">BY</p>

<p class="ac" style="margin-top:3ex;"><span class="sc">G. B. SOWERBY, Jun.</span></p>

  <p>Containing descriptions of all the species hitherto known of the
  following Genera of <span class="sc">Shells</span>; Helicina, Pupina,
  Rostellaria, Aporrhais, Struthiolaria and Strombus, accompanied by 300
  highly finished coloured engravings.</p>

  <p>This work is commenced, and will be continued on a more extensive,
  complete, and economic plan than has hitherto been attempted. It is
  intended to be so complete as to supersede the necessity of keeping an
  extensive conchological library, or of consulting a variety of books for
  the purpose of identifying species. <span class="sc">It will form a
  complete Conchological Library in itself.</span></p>

  <p>The vast increase in the number of species, either undescribed or
  published in miscellaneous works, and voyages; the difficulty of
  obtaining such works, or of naming species without them, and the
  confusion of Synonymes which has been the result, are facts which prove
  the importance of the present undertaking. The facilities enjoyed by the
  author, in having access to several of the most important collections;
  and obtaining the fullest information respecting the localities of
  subjects by those who have sought them in their native abodes, will, it
  is trusted, enable him to supply a generally acknowledged desideratum. He
  hopes to do this in such a manner as to fulfil the expectations of his
  friends, who may rest assured that neither pains nor expense will be
  spared to ensure the correctness, completeness, and beauty of the
  work.</p>

  <p>The plan of the work is as follows:&mdash;it will consist of a
  complete series of Monographs of Genera of Shells. All the species and
  varieties of each genus will be described and figured. The essential
  characters will be given in latin. The explanations and general
  information will be expressed in English. The figures of average sized
  shells will be reduced to half the real diameter; those of larger size
  will be still further reduced; and those of small size will be
  represented of the natural dimensions. The size of the book is Imperial
  octavo. The paper, printing, engraving and colouring of the best
  description. A part, containing several Monographs will appear every
  third month, or oftener if possible, the price of each part to depend
  upon the number of figures which it contains, at the rate of one penny
  for each figure.</p>
